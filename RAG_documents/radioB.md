`11:05:44 UTC — LosAngeles-Ground ⇢ All`

> LA Ground: "All aircraft and operations, be advised: fuel hydrant contamination detected in the LAX ramp network. We have isolated the hydrants and are suspending fuel service for the time being. No fuel uplift at LosAngeles until further notice. We’re investigating."

`11:06:02 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Ops`

> PLANE3: "Ops, copy LAX. We were scheduled to top off at LAX before the transcontinental leg. Current fuel 1532, tank capacity 5204. With no service, we need direction — either reroute passengers to another aircraft with fuel or adjust assignments. Standing by."

`11:06:19 UTC — Ops ⇢ All`

> Ops: "Affirm. Treat LAX as unavailable for fueling. Do not plan any fuel uplift there. Reassign as needed; if aircraft must transit LAX, ensure they have the fuel margin for onward legs."

`11:06:45 UTC — LA Ground ⇢ PLANE5`

> LA Ground: "PLANE5, your VIP pax arriving in 40 — catering and pax transfer teams delayed. Also, if you were counting on fuel at gate 12, that’s offline."

`11:07:02 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ LA Ground`

> PLANE3: "Copy. We’ll keep passengers onboard until ops confirms. Can we get an ETA on when hydrants might be back online?"

`11:07:22 UTC — LA Ground ⇢ All`

> LA Ground: "No ETA yet. Tank samples sent to lab. For now, no aircraft may take on fuel at LosAngeles. Use alternate airports or ensure you arrive with enough fuel for your next segments."

`11:07:38 UTC — Ops ⇢ Dispatch`

> Ops: "Dispatch, check diversion options and confirm which aircraft can accept passengers without refuel. Also note gate congestion — expect taxi delays."

`11:08:03 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Crew`

> Pilot (to crew): "We’ll advise passengers they may need to wait or be transferred. Keep an eye on fuel state; we cannot rely on topping at LAX."

`11:08:25 UTC — Passenger (over PA, PLANE3)`

> "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the inconvenience. Ground services are resolving an issue at LAX; thank you for your patience."
