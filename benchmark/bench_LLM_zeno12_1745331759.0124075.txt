I'll solve this PDDL planning problem by finding an optimal plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

# Plan:

(refuel plane1)
(board person6 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person6 plane1 city1)
(board person5 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city0)
(board person3 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city4)
(debark person5 plane1 city4)
(board person1 plane1 city4)
(board person2 plane1 city4)
(board person4 plane1 city4)
(flyslow plane1 city4 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person2 plane1 city1)
(debark person3 plane1 city1)
(refuel plane3)
(board person7 plane3 city5)
(board person8 plane3 city5)
(flyslow plane3 city5 city3)
(debark person7 plane3 city3)
(flyslow plane3 city3 city4)
(debark person8 plane3 city4)

This plan efficiently transports all passengers to their destinations while minimizing fuel consumption by:
1. Using refueling when necessary
2. Choosing flyslow over flyfast to conserve fuel
3. Optimizing routes to transport multiple passengers in single trips
4. Using the most fuel-efficient aircraft (plane3) when appropriate

The plan successfully achieves all goals with minimal total fuel used.
