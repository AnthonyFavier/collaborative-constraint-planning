I'll solve this ZTRAVEL-2-4 problem by finding an optimal plan that minimizes total fuel used.

First, let me analyze the problem:
- We have 2 planes and 4 people
- Person1 needs to go from city0 to city1
- Person2 needs to stay at city0
- Person3 needs to go from city1 to city0
- Person4 needs to stay at city1
- Plane2 needs to end at city2 (which is already satisfied)

Let me find the optimal solution:

```
(board person3 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person3 plane1 city1)
(board person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city0)
(debark person1 plane1 city0)
```

Wait, I made a mistake. Let me reconsider the initial state:
- Person1 and Person2 are in city0
- Person3 and Person4 are in city1
- Plane1 is in city0
- Plane2 is in city2

The correct plan is:

```
(board person1 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(board person3 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city0)
(debark person3 plane1 city0)
```

This plan uses the slow_burn rate of plane1 (3 units per distance) for both flights:
- city0 to city1: 750 * 3 = 2250 fuel
- city1 to city0: 750 * 3 = 2250 fuel
Total fuel used: 4500

This is the optimal plan as it:
1. Uses the plane with the lower burn rate (plane1)
2. Uses the slower flight mode which consumes less fuel
3. Accomplishes all goals with minimal flights

=================
plan:
(board person1 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(board person3 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city0)
(debark person3 plane1 city0)
