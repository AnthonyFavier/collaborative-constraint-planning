I'll solve this ZTRAVEL-2-4 problem by finding an optimal plan that minimizes total fuel used.

After analyzing the problem, here's my solution:

```
(refuel plane1)
(board person4 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city3)
(debark person4 plane1 city3)
(board person1 plane1 city3)
(flyslow plane1 city3 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(refuel plane2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city0)
(board person2 plane2 city0)
(board person3 plane2 city0)
(flyslow plane2 city0 city3)
(debark person2 plane2 city3)
(debark person3 plane2 city3)
```

This plan:
1. Refuels plane1 in city1
2. Transports person4 from city1 to city3
3. Picks up person1 from city3 and delivers them to city2
4. Refuels plane2 in city2
5. Flies plane2 to city0 to pick up person2 and person3
6. Transports both person2 and person3 to city3

The plan uses slow flying throughout to minimize fuel consumption, and efficiently uses both planes to transport all passengers to their destinations while minimizing the total fuel used.

plan:
(refuel plane1)
(board person4 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city3)
(debark person4 plane1 city3)
(board person1 plane1 city3)
(flyslow plane1 city3 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(refuel plane2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city0)
(board person2 plane2 city0)
(board person3 plane2 city0)
(flyslow plane2 city0 city3)
(debark person2 plane2 city3)
(debark person3 plane2 city3)
