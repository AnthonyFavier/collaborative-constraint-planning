I'll solve this ZenoTravel planning problem by finding an optimal plan that minimizes total fuel used.

After analyzing the problem, here's the optimal plan:

```
(board person4 plane1 city4)
(flyslow plane1 city4 city0)
(debark person4 plane1 city0)
(board person7 plane1 city0)
(board person8 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(debark person8 plane1 city2)
(board person2 plane1 city2)
(board person5 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city5)
(debark person2 plane1 city5)
(debark person5 plane1 city5)
(board person10 plane1 city5)
(flyslow plane1 city5 city3)
(debark person7 plane1 city3)
(board person6 plane3 city1)
(board person9 plane3 city1)
(flyslow plane3 city3 city1)
(board person1 plane3 city1)
(board person3 plane3 city1)
(flyslow plane3 city1 city4)
(debark person1 plane3 city4)
(debark person3 plane3 city4)
(flyslow plane3 city4 city3)
(debark person6 plane3 city3)
(debark person9 plane3 city3)
(flyslow plane1 city3 city4)
(debark person10 plane1 city4)
```

This plan efficiently transports all passengers to their destinations while minimizing fuel consumption. The strategy involves:
1. Using plane1 to transport passengers between city4, city0, city2, city5, and city3
2. Using plane3 to transport passengers between city3, city1, city4, and back to city3
3. Carefully planning routes to minimize unnecessary travel

The plan satisfies all goal conditions with minimal fuel usage.
