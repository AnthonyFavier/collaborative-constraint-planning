I'll solve this problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used while achieving the goal of transporting the three people to their destinations.

Let me analyze the problem:
- We need to transport person1 from city0 to city2
- We need to transport person2 from city0 to city1
- We need to transport person3 from city1 to city2
- We have one plane (plane1) starting at city0 with 4000 fuel units
- We need to minimize total fuel used

Here's my solution:

```
(board person1 plane1 city0)
(board person2 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person2 plane1 city1)
(board person3 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(debark person3 plane1 city2)
```

Let me verify the fuel consumption:
- Flying slow from city0 to city1: 678 * 4 = 2712 fuel units
- Flying slow from city1 to city2: 810 * 4 = 3240 fuel units
- Total fuel used: 2712 + 3240 = 5952 fuel units

The plane starts with 4000 fuel units, which is enough for the first leg (2712 < 4000), but after reaching city1, it would have 4000 - 2712 = 1288 fuel units, which is not enough for the second leg (3240 > 1288). So we need to refuel at city1:

```
(board person1 plane1 city0)
(board person2 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person2 plane1 city1)
(board person3 plane1 city1)
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(debark person3 plane1 city2)
```

This plan achieves all goals while minimizing fuel usage by using the slow_burn flying mode throughout.

=================
plan:
(board person1 plane1 city0)
(board person2 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city1)
(debark person2 plane1 city1)
(board person3 plane1 city1)
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(debark person3 plane1 city2)
