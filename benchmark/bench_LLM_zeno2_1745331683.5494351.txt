I'll solve this ZTRAVEL problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

First, let me analyze the problem:
- We have a plane (plane1) starting at city0 with 1773 fuel units
- person1 is at city2 and needs to go to city1
- person2 is at city1 (no goal for this person)
- person3 is at city2 and needs to stay at city2
- plane1 needs to end at city2

Let me calculate the optimal plan:

```
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
```

Let's verify this plan:
1. Fly plane1 from city0 to city2: Uses 998 * 3 = 2994 fuel units
   - But plane1 only has 1773 fuel units, so we need to refuel first

Corrected plan:
```
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
```

Let's calculate the fuel usage:
- After refuel: plane1 has 6830 fuel units
- flyslow city0→city2: 998 * 3 = 2994 fuel units
- flyslow city2→city1: 631 * 3 = 1893 fuel units
- flyslow city1→city2: 631 * 3 = 1893 fuel units
- Total fuel used: 2994 + 1893 + 1893 = 6780 fuel units

This plan satisfies all goals:
- plane1 ends at city2
- person1 is moved from city2 to city1
- person3 stays at city2 (no action needed)

Final plan:
```
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
```

=================
plan:
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
