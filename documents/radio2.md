# Transcript A — "Propulsion controller advisory (Washington / PLANE2)"

`09:12:03 UTC — ATC-Washington ⇢ PLANE2`

> ATC: "Plane2, this is Washington Tower. Did you receive the maintenance brief from midnight checks?"

`09:12:15 UTC — PLANE2 ⇢ ATC-Washington`

> PLANE2: "Washington Tower, we copy. Techs report a propulsion controller anomaly discovered overnight. Symptoms are intermittent surging when we push beyond normal cruise settings. They cleared us for flight but advise we keep power settings at or below cruise, avoid any sustained high-thrust requests until the unit is bench-checked. Fuel readout steady at 1469. No immediate hazard, but we’ll follow the throttle limitation. Over."

`09:12:28 UTC — ATC-Washington ⇢ Ops`

> ATC: "Ops, be advised: PLANE2 has a propulsion anomaly — do not plan any legs that require sustained high power for Plane2. We’ll update after diagnostics."

`09:12:34 UTC — Ground-Tech-Washington ⇢ PLANE2`

> Tech: "Roger. We logged the fault code and isolated the actuator. We need a full bench run before restoring high-thrust envelope — ETA TBD. Suggest planning around the limitation."

`09:13:01 UTC — PLANE2 ⇢ Dispatch`

> PLANE2: "Dispatch, we currently have eight pax listed for the next rotation — confirm whether ops want us to carry or transfer. Also toggling anti-ice earlier produced a faint vibration; nothing flagged but we logged it."

`09:13:22 UTC — Ops ⇢ PLANE2`

> Ops: "Copy. Hold passengers if possible; we’re checking transfer options. Also: catering delay of 12 minutes, gate change to 4B in 20. Weather shows gusting crosswind but within limits."

`09:13:40 UTC — PLANE2 ⇢ Crew`

> Pilot (to crew): "Keep the throttle in the green band. If we hit turbulence, keep speed management conservative — passenger comfort prioritized. No push to higher power unless cleared by techs."

# Transcript B — "LosAngeles ground services — fueling outage"

`11:05:44 UTC — LosAngeles-Ground ⇢ All`

> LA Ground: "All aircraft and operations, be advised: fuel hydrant contamination detected in the LAX ramp network. We have isolated the hydrants and are suspending fuel service for the time being. No fuel uplift at LosAngeles until further notice. We’re investigating."

`11:06:02 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Ops`

> PLANE3: "Ops, copy LAX. We were scheduled to top off at LAX before the transcontinental leg. Current fuel 1532, tank capacity 5204. With no service, we need direction — either reroute passengers to another aircraft with fuel or adjust assignments. Standing by."

`11:06:19 UTC — Ops ⇢ All`

> Ops: "Affirm. Treat LAX as unavailable for fueling. Do not plan any fuel uplift there. Reassign as needed; if aircraft must transit LAX, ensure they have the fuel margin for onward legs."

`11:06:45 UTC — LA Ground ⇢ PLANE5`

> LA Ground: "PLANE5, your VIP pax arriving in 40 — catering and pax transfer teams delayed. Also, if you were counting on fuel at gate 12, that’s offline."

`11:07:02 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ LA Ground`

> PLANE3: "Copy. We’ll keep passengers onboard until ops confirms. Can we get an ETA on when hydrants might be back online?"

`11:07:22 UTC — LA Ground ⇢ All`

> LA Ground: "No ETA yet. Tank samples sent to lab. For now, no aircraft may take on fuel at LosAngeles. Use alternate airports or ensure you arrive with enough fuel for your next segments."

`11:07:38 UTC — Ops ⇢ Dispatch`

> Ops: "Dispatch, check diversion options and confirm which aircraft can accept passengers without refuel. Also note gate congestion — expect taxi delays."

`11:08:03 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Crew`

> Pilot (to crew): "We’ll advise passengers they may need to wait or be transferred. Keep an eye on fuel state; we cannot rely on topping at LAX."

`11:08:25 UTC — Passenger (over PA, PLANE3)`

> "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the inconvenience. Ground services are resolving an issue at LAX; thank you for your patience."
