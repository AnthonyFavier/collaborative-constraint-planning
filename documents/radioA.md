`09:12:03 UTC — ATC-Washington ⇢ PLANE3`

> ATC: "Plane3, this is Washington Tower. Did you receive the maintenance brief from midnight checks?"

`09:12:15 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ ATC-Washington`

> PLANE3: "Washington Tower, we copy. Techs report a propulsion controller anomaly discovered overnight. Symptoms are intermittent surging when we push beyond normal cruise settings. They cleared us for flight but advise we keep power settings at or below cruise, avoid any sustained high-thrust requests until the unit is bench-checked. Fuel readout steady at 1469. No immediate hazard, but we’ll follow the throttle limitation. Over."

`09:12:28 UTC — ATC-Washington ⇢ Ops`

> ATC: "Ops, be advised: PLANE3 has a propulsion anomaly — do not plan any legs that require sustained high power for Plane3. We’ll update after diagnostics."

`09:12:34 UTC — Ground-Tech-Washington ⇢ PLANE3`

> Tech: "Roger. We logged the fault code and isolated the actuator. We need a full bench run before restoring high-thrust envelope — ETA TBD. Suggest planning around the limitation."

`09:13:01 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Dispatch`

> PLANE3: "Dispatch, we currently have eight pax listed for the next rotation — confirm whether ops want us to carry or transfer. Also toggling anti-ice earlier produced a faint vibration; nothing flagged but we logged it."

`09:13:22 UTC — Ops ⇢ PLANE3`

> Ops: "Copy. Hold passengers if possible; we’re checking transfer options. Also: catering delay of 12 minutes, gate change to 4B in 20. Weather shows gusting crosswind but within limits."

`09:13:40 UTC — PLANE3 ⇢ Crew`

> Pilot (to crew): "Keep the throttle in the green band. If we hit turbulence, keep speed management conservative — passenger comfort prioritized. No push to higher power unless cleared by techs."
