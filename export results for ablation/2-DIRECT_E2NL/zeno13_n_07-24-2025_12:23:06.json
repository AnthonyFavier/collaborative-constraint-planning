This means that in the solution, only plane1 should be used for transportation, and plane2 and plane3 should not be used.\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see that there are several actions that involve aircraft:\n- board: a person boards an aircraft\n- debark: a person debarks from an aircraft  \n- flyslow: an aircraft flies slowly between cities\n- flyfast: an aircraft flies fast between cities\n- refuel: an aircraft refuels\n\nThe constraint \"Only use plane1\" means that:\n- No person should board plane2 or plane3\n- No person should debark from plane2 or plane3 (though this would be impossible if they never board)\n- plane2 and plane3 should not fly anywhere\n- plane2 and plane3 should not refuel\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as state-based constraints. I can use the always operator to ensure that throughout the execution, certain conditions hold.\n\nLet me think about what predicates and functions I can use:\n- (in ?p - person ?a - aircraft) - indicates a person is in an aircraft\n- (located ?a - aircraft ?c - city) - indicates where an aircraft is located\n- (onboard ?a - aircraft) - function indicating how many people are on board\n\nFor \"only use plane1\", I could express this as:\n- No person should ever be in plane2 or plane3\n- plane2 and plane3 should always stay in their initial locations\n- The onboard count for plane2 and plane3 should always be 0\n\nLet me check the initial state:\n- plane1 is initially at city4\n- plane2 is initially at city2  \n- plane3 is initially at city3\n\nSo the constraints could be:\n- (always (= (onboard plane2) 0))\n- (always (= (onboard plane3) 0))\n\n\n- (always (located plane2 city2))\n- (always (located plane3 city3))\n\nI'm considering two potential interpretations of the constraint. One focuses on preventing any actions for plane2 and plane3, ensuring they remain stationary and empty. The other emphasizes that only plane1 should be used for transportation, which means strictly controlling the movement and use of the other planes.\n\nThe goal is to create a clear set of constraints that keep plane2 and plane3 completely inactive. This involves preventing any people from boarding these planes and maintaining their initial locations. The onboard count naturally follows from these restrictions, making explicit zero-passenger constraints potentially redundant."

Looking at the domain, there's a refuel action that increases the fuel of an aircraft to its capacity.\n\nIn the initial state:\n- plane2 has fuel = 1469 and capacity = 12132\n- plane3 has fuel = 1532 and capacity = 5204\n\nTo prevent refueling, I need to ensure that the fuel level of plane2 and plane3 never changes from their initial values. Since refueling is the only action that changes fuel (the fly actions decrease fuel), I can add constraints that the fuel should always remain at their initial levels.\n\nSo I need to add:\n- (always (= (fuel plane2) 1469))\n- (always (= (fuel plane3) 1532))\n\nThis will prevent any refueling of these planes."
