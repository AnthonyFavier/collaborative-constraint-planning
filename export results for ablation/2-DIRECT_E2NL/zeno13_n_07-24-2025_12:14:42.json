What does it mean for these objects to be \"ignored\"? In the context of planning, this likely means that these objects should not be used in any actions during the plan execution.\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see the following actions:\n- board: involves a person and an aircraft\n- debark: involves a person and an aircraft  \n- flyslow: involves an aircraft\n- flyfast: involves an aircraft\n- refuel: involves an aircraft\n\nSo for person7 to be \"ignored\", it should not participate in any board or debark actions.\nFor plane2 and plane3 to be \"ignored\", they should not participate in any board, debark, flyslow, flyfast, or refuel actions.\n\nHowever, PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based and cannot directly refer to actions. They can only refer to predicates and fluents.\n\nOne way to express this is to ensure that the state never changes in ways that would indicate these objects were used. But this is tricky because we need to think about what would indicate usage.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The domain has some counter functions that track action usage:\n- (n_board ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_refuel ?a - aircraft)\n\nThese functions count how many times each action is performed with specific parameters.\n\nSo to ensure person7, plane2, and plane3 are \"ignored\", we can require that:\n1. For person7: all n_board and n_debark counters involving person7 remain 0\n\n\n2. For plane2: all n_board, n_debark, n_flyslow, n_flyfast, and n_refuel counters involving plane2 remain 0\n3. For plane3: all n_board, n_debark, n_flyslow, n_flyfast, and n_refuel counters involving plane3 remain 0\n\nI'll track the constraint using the domain's action counters, ensuring these specific objects are never used in any actions throughout the plan.\n\nThe PDDL constraint will prevent person7 from boarding or disembarking any aircraft, and restrict plane2 from participating in any refueling, slow flight, or fast flight actions across all cities. I'll continue defining the comprehensive constraint to ensure zero activity for these specific entities.\n\nThe next constraint extends similar restrictions to plane3, prohibiting its refueling, slow and fast flight movements, and preventing any persons from boarding or disembarking this aircraft in any city. These systematic constraints effectively immobilize specific aircraft and limit person7's transportation options."
