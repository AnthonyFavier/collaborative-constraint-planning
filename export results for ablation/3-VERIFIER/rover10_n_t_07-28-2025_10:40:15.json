This is a temporal constraint that needs to hold always.\n3. In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed using the \"always\" temporal operator.\n4. The predicate for a rover being in a waypoint is \"(in ?x - rover ?y - waypoint)\"\n\nSo I need to express that it's always the case that no rover is in waypoint2 and no rover is in waypoint5.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be:\n(always (and (not (exists (?r - rover) (in ?r waypoint2)))\n             (not (exists (?r - rover) (in ?r waypoint5)))))\n\nOr equivalently:\n(always (forall (?r - rover) (and (not (in ?r waypoint2))\n                                  (not (in ?r waypoint5)))))\n\nLet me check the domain to see what rovers are available:\n- rover0, rover1, rover2, rover3\n\nSo I could also write it more explicitly as:\n(always (and (not (in rover0 waypoint2))\n             (not (in rover1 waypoint2))\n             (not (in rover2 waypoint2))\n             (not (in rover3 waypoint2))\n             (not (in rover0 waypoint5))\n             (not (in rover1 waypoint5))\n             (not (in rover2 waypoint5))\n             (not (in rover3 waypoint5))))\n\nBut the quantified version is more general and cleaner.
