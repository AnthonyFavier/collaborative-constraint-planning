Looking at the problem, I can see:\n   - rover0 is equipped for both soil and rock analysis: (equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0) and (equipped_for_rock_analysis rover0)\n   - There are soil and rock samples at waypoint4: (at_soil_sample waypoint4) and (at_rock_sample waypoint4)\n   - The goal includes: (communicated_soil_data waypoint4) and (communicated_rock_data waypoint4)\n\n3. For rover0 to \"handle\" the analysis means:\n   - rover0 should perform the samplesoil action at waypoint4\n   - rover0 should perform the samplerock action at waypoint4\n   - rover0 should communicate the soil data from waypoint4\n   - rover0 should communicate the rock data from waypoint4\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- samplesoil creates (have_soil_analysis ?x ?p) \n- samplerock creates (have_rock_analysis ?x ?p)\n- communicatesoildata requires (have_soil_analysis ?r ?p) and creates (communicated_soil_data ?p)\n- communicaterockdata requires (have_rock_analysis ?r ?p) and creates (communicated_rock_data ?p)\n\nSo the constraint should ensure that:\n1. If soil data from waypoint4 is communicated, it was rover0 who analyzed it\n2. If rock data from waypoint4 is communicated, it was rover0 who analyzed it\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as state-based constraints. \n\nI notice an important detail about the communication actions. The communicatesoildata and communicaterockdata actions don't remove the analysis predicates. This means when data is communicated, the rover retains its analysis capability. \n\nThe key constraint becomes ensuring rover0 is the sole source of analysis for waypoint4's soil and rock samples. This requires tracking both the analysis and communication predicates to maintain rover0's exclusive responsibility for this waypoint's data collection and transmission.\n\nThe constraint implies that if soil or rock data from waypoint4 is communicated, rover0 must be the rover who originally performed the analysis. This preserves the rover's unique role in sampling and reporting scientific data from this specific location.\n\nThe predicate structure ensures that communication of data is directly linked to rover0's analytical work, creating a clear chain of scientific responsibility for waypoint4's geological information."

But let me double check the PDDL3.0 syntax.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. In PDDL3.0, constraints are typically expressed using temporal logic operators. The common operators are:\n\n- (always <condition>) - the condition must hold in all states\n- (sometime <condition>) - the condition must hold in at least one state  \n- (at-most-once <condition>) - the condition can hold in at most one state\n- (sometime-after <condition1> <condition2>) - condition2 must hold sometime after condition1\n- (sometime-before <condition1> <condition2>) - condition1 must hold sometime before condition2\n- (within <number> <condition>) - condition must hold within number time units\n- (always-within <number> <condition1> <condition2>) - whenever condition1 holds, condition2 must hold within number time units\n- (hold-during <number1> <number2> <condition>) - condition must hold during the interval\n- (hold-after <number> <condition>) - condition must hold after number time units\n\nBut actually, let me look at basic logical operators in PDDL. The implication operator in PDDL is typically \"imply\" but let me check if this is correct syntax.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at PDDL syntax, I think the issue might be with the implication syntax. In standard PDDL, implications are written as:\n\n(imply <antecedent> <consequent>)\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"imply\" is the right operator. Let me think about what other logical operators are available.\n\nActually, in PDDL3.0 constraints, we might need to use different syntax. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe constraint \"Rover0 should handle soil and rock analysis from waypoint4\" means that rover0 should be the one responsible for these tasks. \n\n\nI see the predicates define specific conditions for analysis and communication. The key is to create a logical relationship between data communication and rover0's analysis. I'll construct an implication that ensures rover0 must perform the analysis before data communication occurs. The constraint needs to link the analysis predicates with the communication predicates using a logical implication structure.\n\nThe PDDL syntax for expressing this constraint requires careful consideration of quantifiers and logical operators. I'm exploring different approaches to accurately represent this logical dependency between analysis and communication actions.\n\nI'll investigate standard PDDL logical operators to ensure precise constraint formulation, focusing on the correct implementation of implication in the domain specification."
