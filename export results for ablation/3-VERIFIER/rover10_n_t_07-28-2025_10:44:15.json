There needs to be rock analysis from waypoint1\n2. This rock analysis should happen before other rock analyses\n\nLooking at the PDDL domain, I can see there's a predicate `(have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint)` which indicates that a rover has performed rock analysis at a waypoint.\n\nThe constraint \"Rock analysis from waypoint1 should be performed first\" means that before any other rock analysis is performed (i.e., before `(have_rock_analysis ?r ?w)` becomes true for any waypoint other than waypoint1), we must first have `(have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1)` be true.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can use temporal logic operators. The key insight is that this is a precedence constraint - rock analysis at waypoint1 must precede rock analysis at any other waypoint.\n\nI can express this using the \"until\" temporal operator or implication. The constraint could be:\n\nFor any rover ?r and any waypoint ?w that is not waypoint1, if (have_rock_analysis ?r ?w) becomes true, then (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1) must already be true.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at PDDL3.0 temporal logic, I think I should use the \"sometime-before\" construct or similar.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The constraint says \"Rock analysis from waypoint1 should be performed first\". This means:\n\n- Before any rock analysis is done at any other waypoint, rock analysis must be done at waypoint1\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can express this as:\n- For all rovers ?r and all waypoints ?w (where ?w != waypoint1), if (have_rock_analysis ?r ?w) then (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1) must have been true at some earlier point.\n \nI see multiple rock sample locations: waypoint0, waypoint1, waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint6. The constraint specifically requires waypoint1's rock analysis to be completed first among these locations.\n\nThe \"sometime-before\" operator perfectly captures this temporal requirement, ensuring waypoint1's rock analysis precedes analyses at other waypoints with rock samples.\n\nI'm carefully considering the precise interpretation of this constraint. There are two potential meanings: either any rover must analyze waypoint1 before other waypoints, or the first rock analysis overall must occur at waypoint1.\n\nThe more intuitive interpretation seems to be that rock analysis at waypoint1 must happen before analyses at any other waypoint, regardless of which rover performs the task.\n\nI'll need to craft a PDDL3.0 temporal constraint that captures this nuanced requirement. The goal is to express: \"Rock analysis at waypoint1 must precede any rock analysis at other waypoints.\"\n\nThe constraint involves universal quantification across rovers and waypoints, ensuring a specific temporal ordering of rock sample analysis. I'll need to carefully construct the logical expression to accurately represent this constraint.\n\nThe challenge is creating a precise temporal relationship that prevents rock analysis at other waypoints before the initial analysis at waypoint1. This requires a careful combination of logical implication and temporal operators.\n\nMy approach will focus on establishing a clear temporal precedence for rock analysis events across different waypoints, using PDDL3.0's sophisticated temporal logic capabilities.\n\nThe key constraint is ensuring waypoint1 receives its rock analysis first, before any other waypoint can be analyzed. The \"until\" operator provides an elegant solution by explicitly blocking rock analysis elsewhere until the initial condition is met.\n\nThis formulation effectively prevents parallel or premature rock analysis strategies, mandating a sequential exploration protocol that prioritizes waypoint1 as the initial scientific target."
