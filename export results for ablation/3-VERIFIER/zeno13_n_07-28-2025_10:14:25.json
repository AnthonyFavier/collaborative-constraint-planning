This needs to be a state-based constraint in PDDL3.0.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as a state constraint that holds throughout the plan execution. The constraint should say that:\n- If person1 is in some aircraft, then person3 should be in the same aircraft\n- If person3 is in some aircraft, then person1 should be in the same aircraft\n\nThis can be expressed using implication and quantifiers. In PDDL3.0, state constraints use the `:constraints` section and can use temporal logic operators.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint should be that whenever person1 is in an aircraft, person3 is in the same aircraft, and vice versa.\n\nThis can be written as:\n- For all aircraft ?a, if person1 is in ?a, then person3 is also in ?a\n- For all aircraft ?a, if person3 is in ?a, then person1 is also in ?a\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be:\n```\n(always (forall (?a - aircraft)\n  (and \n    (imply (in person1 ?a) (in person3 ?a))\n    (imply (in person3 ?a) (in person1 ?a))\n  )\n))\n```\n\nActually, let me think about this again. The constraint \"travel together\" could mean they should be in the same aircraft whenever either of them is in an aircraft. \n\nI recognize the nuanced interpretation requires careful consideration of their simultaneous aircraft presence. The constraint implies a strict synchronization of their travel movements, ensuring they are always co-located during air travel.\n\nThe key challenge is precisely defining what \"travel together\" means in the context of aircraft movement and location constraints. I'll need to carefully model their joint travel requirements to capture the intended behavior.\n\nThe logical formulation needs to guarantee that whenever one person is in an aircraft, the other must also be in that exact same aircraft, creating a mutual dependency for their air transportation.\n\nI can express this constraint through two key principles: preventing simultaneous presence in different aircraft and ensuring mutual aircraft occupancy. The specification requires that person1 and person3 are always co-located during air travel, with no exceptions.\n\nThe constraint translates to a precise logical rule where their aircraft presence is perfectly synchronized, eliminating any possibility of separate flight arrangements."
