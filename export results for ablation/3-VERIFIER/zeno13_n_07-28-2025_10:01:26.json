In PDDL3.0, this can be expressed as constraints that prevent certain actions from being taken with these entities.\n\nFor person7, we want to prevent:\n- boarding person7 onto any aircraft\n- debarking person7 from any aircraft (though person7 starts on the ground)\n\nFor plane2 and plane3, we want to prevent:\n- any person boarding these planes\n- any person debarking from these planes\n- these planes flying anywhere (flyslow or flyfast)\n- refueling these planes\n\nIn PDDL3.0, we can use the `always` temporal constraint to ensure these restrictions hold throughout the plan execution.\n\nLet me think about the specific predicates and actions:\n\nFor person7:\n- We want to always ensure person7 is not in any aircraft: `(not (in person7 ?a))`\n- Or we could prevent the board action for person7\n\nFor plane2 and plane3:\n- We want to ensure no one is ever in these planes: `(not (in ?p plane2))` and `(not (in ?p plane3))`\n- We want to ensure these planes never change location\n- We could prevent all actions involving these planes\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the most straightforward way to \"ignore\" these entities is to ensure they don't participate in any actions. In PDDL3.0, we can use `always` constraints.\n\nLet me formulate this:\n\n```pddl\n(always (not (in person7 ?a - aircraft)))\n(always (not (in ?p - person plane2)))\n\n\n(always (not (in ?p - person plane3)))\n(always (located plane2 city2))\n(always (located plane3 city3))\n(always (located person7 city0))\n```\n\nI'll refine the constraints to explicitly prevent any movement or interaction. The key is to create temporal constraints that lock these entities in place and prevent any actions involving them. This ensures they remain static throughout the entire plan execution, effectively \"ignoring\" them by making them unavailable for any plan-related activities.\n\nThe constraints focus on three critical aspects:\n1. Keeping person7 stationary in city0\n2. Preventing plane2 from any operational use\n3. Preventing plane3 from any operational use\n\nThese constraints will fundamentally restrict the planning domain's flexibility by creating immutable conditions for these specific entities.\n\nThe key predicates involve location tracking and aircraft occupancy, ensuring precise spatial and personnel constraints through PDDL's logical specification.\n\nI want to establish immutable constraints for specific entities: person7 must remain stationary in city0, while plane2 and plane3 are locked to their respective cities with zero passenger capacity. The goal is creating absolute restrictions preventing any movement or passenger interactions for these entities.\n\nThe PDDL constraints would systematically block boarding, disembarking, and location changes, effectively rendering person7, plane2, and plane3 completely static within their initial configurations.\n\nSpecifically, this means implementing preventative logic that categorically prohibits any action that might alter the initial state of these entities, maintaining their absolute positional and occupancy constraints. I'll ensure person7 remains stationary in city0, while plane2 and plane3 stay fixed in their respective cities without any passenger interactions. The constraints lock these entities into their initial states, effectively removing them from active planning considerations. By specifying precise location and passenger constraints, we create a planning environment that treats these specific entities as static background elements.\n\nThe strategy involves using PDDL3.0's always predicates to create immutable state conditions that prevent any movement or interaction for these specific entities. This approach simplifies the planning process by establishing clear, unchanging parameters for person7, plane2, and plane3."
