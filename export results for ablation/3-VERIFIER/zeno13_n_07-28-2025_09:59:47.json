They should not be used in any actions\n2. They should remain in their initial state\n3. No actions should be performed on them\n\nLooking at the domain, the relevant predicates and fluents are:\n- (located ?x - locatable ?c - city) - for location\n- (in ?p - person ?a - aircraft) - for people being in aircraft\n- (fuel ?a - aircraft) - aircraft fuel\n- (onboard ?a - aircraft) - number of people on aircraft\n\nFor person7, \"being ignored\" would mean:\n- person7 should stay at their initial location (city0)\n- person7 should never board any aircraft\n- No aircraft should ever have person7 on board\n\nFor plane2 and plane3, \"being ignored\" would mean:\n- They should stay at their initial locations (city2 and city3 respectively)\n- No person should ever board them\n- They should never fly anywhere\n- They should never refuel\n- Their fuel level should remain the same\n- Their onboard count should remain 0\n\nSince PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based and can use temporal logic operators, I need to use the \"always\" operator to ensure these conditions hold throughout the plan.\n\nLet me formulate this:\n\nFor person7:\n- always (located person7 city0) - person7 stays in city0\n- always (not (in person7 plane1)) - person7 never boards plane1\n- always (not (in person7 plane2)) - person7 never boards plane2  \n- always (not (in person7 plane3)) - person7 never boards plane3\n \nI'll specify additional constraints for plane2 and plane3 to ensure they remain static:\n\nPlane constraints focus on maintaining their exact initial state. This means preventing any changes to their location, passenger count, or fuel levels. The goal is to create a temporal logic constraint that locks these aircraft in place, ensuring they cannot participate in any planning actions.\n\nFor plane2, the key constraints involve:\n- Permanent location in city2\n- Zero passenger occupancy\n- Maintaining initial fuel level\n\nFor plane3, similar immutability constraints apply:\n- Permanent location in city3\n- Zero passenger occupancy\n- Preserving initial fuel quantity\n\nThese constraints effectively create a planning environment where plane2 and plane3 are completely isolated from any potential transportation or movement actions. I'll ensure no person is in plane2 or plane3, with plane2 at city2 and plane3 at city3, both having zero passengers and their specified fuel levels. The constraints cover all persons being excluded from these planes, maintaining their initial stationary positions and fuel states. I'll continue the partial thought from the previous rewritten thinking about simplifying the constraints. The planes remain stationary with zero passengers, and the fuel levels are specified for each plane. Person7 stays in city0 and is not on plane1. The constraints have been streamlined to remove redundant conditions about person7's location relative to plane2 and plane3."
