The constraint should say that for any person and any city, the number of times that person has been debarked in that city should be at most 1.\n\nSince this is a temporal constraint that must always hold, I should use the `always` operator from PDDL3.0.\n\nThe constraint would be:\n- For all persons p and all cities c, n_debark(p, a, c) <= 1\n\nBut wait, n_debark takes three parameters: person, aircraft, and city. The constraint is about a person being debarked in a city, regardless of which aircraft. So I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the function definition again:\n`(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)`\n\nThis tracks the number of times person p has been debarked from aircraft a in city c. But the constraint is about a person never being debarked in the same city more than once, regardless of aircraft.\n\nSo I need to express that for any person p and city c, the sum of n_debark(p, a, c) over all aircraft a should be at most 1.\n\n\nI'll craft a PDDL3.0 constraint that captures this requirement, ensuring a person can't be debarked multiple times in the same city across different aircraft. The challenge is creating a generalized constraint that works for any number of aircraft.\n\nThe constraint needs to sum the debark count across all possible aircraft, limiting it to 1 for each person-city combination. This prevents multiple debarkations in the same city, regardless of the specific aircraft used.\n\nThe tracking function n_debark precisely records these debarkation events, allowing us to enforce this rule systematically. By limiting the total debarkations to 1, we prevent redundant or unnecessary city stops for each individual.\n\nThe constraint uses a universal quantification across all planes and cities, ensuring no person can exit multiple aircraft in the same location. This elegant logical formulation guarantees unique city debarking for each traveler."
