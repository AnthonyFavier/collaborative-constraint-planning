The constraint would be something like:\n\n```\n(always (forall (?w - waypoint) \n  (<= (count-rovers-at ?w) 1)))\n```\n\nBut wait, I don't think PDDL3.0 has a built-in count function. Let me think about this differently.\n\nActually, the constraint can be expressed more directly. For each waypoint, at most one rover can be there. This means that for any two different rovers r1 and r2, they cannot both be at the same waypoint w at the same time.\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n```\n(always (forall (?w - waypoint ?r1 - rover ?r2 - rover)\n  (imply (and (not (= ?r1 ?r2)) (in ?r1 ?w))\n         (not (in ?r2 ?w)))))\n```\n\nThis says: always, for all waypoints w and rovers r1, r2, if r1 and r2 are different rovers and r1 is at waypoint w, then r2 is not at waypoint w.\n\n\nI'll verify the syntax for temporal constraints in PDDL3.0, focusing on the precise logical formulation that ensures no two rovers occupy the same waypoint simultaneously. The key is using the `always` operator to create a persistent constraint across the entire plan's timeline.\n\nThe constraint maintains the core logic of preventing multiple rovers from sharing a single waypoint, using universal quantification to cover all possible rover combinations and waypoints. This approach ensures a robust representation of the spatial exclusivity requirement.\n\nThe logical structure leverages standard first-order logic predicates and temporal operators to create a comprehensive spatial restriction mechanism that holds true throughout the entire planning process.\n\nThe constraint ensures rovers cannot simultaneously occupy identical waypoints by using universal quantification and implication. Specifically, it establishes that when a rover is located at a particular waypoint, no other distinct rover can simultaneously exist at that same location."

The rovers can move between waypoints using the navigate action.\n\nThe constraint is asking that at no point in time should two or more rovers be at the same waypoint simultaneously. This is a state-based constraint that needs to be expressed in natural language without PDDL syntax.\n\nI need to think about how to express this. The constraint is essentially saying that for any waypoint, at most one rover can be there at any given time. \n\nLet me think about how to decompose this:\n\n1. I could express it as \"At any given time, each waypoint can have at most one rover\"\n2. Or I could be more specific and say \"No two rovers can be at the same waypoint simultaneously\"\n3. I could also think about it from the rover perspective: \"Each rover must be at a different waypoint from all other rovers\"\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint is about mutual exclusion - no two rovers can occupy the same waypoint at the same time. This is a global constraint that applies to all waypoints and all rovers throughout the entire execution.\n\nI think the most natural way to express this is:\n1. At any point in time, each waypoint contains at most one rover\n2. No two rovers can be located at the same waypoint simultaneously\n\nActually, these are essentially saying the same thing. Let me think if I need to decompose this further.\n\nThe constraint is actually quite atomic - it's about spatial exclusion. I don't think it needs to be decomposed into multiple constraints since it's already expressing a single, clear requirement.\n\nBut let me consider if there are edge cases or different ways to think about this:\n- From the waypoint perspective: each waypoint has at most one rover\n\n\n- From the rover perspective: each rover is at a different waypoint than all others\n\nThese perspectives are logically equivalent, highlighting the spatial constraint from different angles. The waypoint view provides a more direct and concise expression of the mutual exclusion requirement."
