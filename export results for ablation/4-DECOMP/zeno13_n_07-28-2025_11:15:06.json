This means:\n- (always (not (in person1 plane2)))\n- (always (not (in person2 plane2)))\n- etc.\n\nOr I could express it as:\n(always (and (not (in person1 plane2))\n             (not (in person2 plane2))\n             (not (in person3 plane2))\n             (not (in person4 plane2))\n             (not (in person5 plane2))\n             (not (in person6 plane2))\n             (not (in person7 plane2))\n             (not (in person8 plane2))\n             (not (in person9 plane2))\n             (not (in person10 plane2))))\n\nI'll verify a more concise way to express this universal constraint across all persons. The goal is to create a comprehensive temporal constraint ensuring no individual can be inside plane2 throughout the entire plan execution."

This is a temporal constraint that applies throughout the entire plan execution\n2. It states that no person should be inside plane3 at any point in time\n3. In PDDL, a person being inside an aircraft is represented by the predicate (in ?p - person ?a - aircraft)\n\nSo the constraint is saying that for all persons and for all time points, the predicate (in ?p plane3) should be false.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, temporal logic operators include:\n- always: the condition must hold throughout the entire plan\n- sometime: the condition must hold at some point during the plan\n- at-most-once: the condition can hold at most once during the plan\n- sometime-after: after one condition becomes true, another must eventually become true\n- sometime-before: before one condition becomes true, another must have been true at some point\n\nFor this constraint, I need \"always\" because it must hold throughout the entire plan.\n\nThe constraint should be:\n(always (forall (?p - person) (not (in ?p plane3))))\n\nActually, let me double-check the PDDL3.0 syntax. In PDDL3.0, constraints are typically written in the form:\n\n(:constraints\n  (always <condition>)\n)\n\nWhere <condition> is a logical expression.\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n(always (forall (?p - person) (not (in ?p plane3))))\n\nThis means: \"Always, for all persons p, it is not the case that p is in plane3\"\n\nThis captures the meaning that no person should ever be inside plane3 at any point during the plan."

In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed using the \"always\" temporal operator.\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see that there's a predicate `(located ?x - locatable ?c - city)` where aircraft are a subtype of locatable. So plane2 being at city2 would be expressed as `(located plane2 city2)`.\n\nThe constraint \"always remain at city2\" means that throughout the entire execution of the plan, plane2 must be located at city2. This is expressed in PDDL3.0 using the `always` operator.\n\nThe PDDL3.0 syntax for this would be:\n`(always (located plane2 city2))`\n\nThis means that at every point in time during the plan execution, plane2 must be located at city2."

Looking at the domain, there's a predicate `(located ?x - locatable ?c - city)` where plane3 would be a locatable and city3 would be a city.\n\nSo the constraint should be:\n`(always (located plane3 city3))`\n\nThis means that at every time point in the plan, plane3 must be located at city3.\n\nLet me double-check this makes sense with the problem:\n- In the initial state: `(located plane3 city3)` - so plane3 starts at city3\n- The constraint says it should always remain there\n- This would prevent any fly actions involving plane3\n\nYes, this seems correct. The PDDL3.0 constraint should be `(always (located plane3 city3))`."

Let me analyze what this means in the context of the given problem.\n\nLooking at the PDDL domain, I can see there are actions that involve aircraft:\n- board: puts a person in an aircraft\n- debark: removes a person from an aircraft  \n- flyslow: flies an aircraft from one city to another slowly\n- flyfast: flies an aircraft from one city to another fast\n- refuel: refuels an aircraft\n\nThe problem has 3 aircraft: plane1, plane2, and plane3.\n\nThe constraint \"Only use plane1\" means that:\n1. No person should ever board plane2 or plane3\n2. No person should ever be inside plane2 or plane3\n3. Plane2 and plane3 should never move from their initial locations\n4. Plane2 and plane3 should never be refueled\n\nSince constraints must be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, I need to express this in terms of states rather than actions.\n\nLet me think about how to decompose this:\n\n1. No person should ever be in plane2 or plane3 (this covers boarding constraint)\n2. Plane2 should always remain at its initial location (city2)\n3. Plane3 should always remain at its initial location (city3)\n4. Plane2 should never be refueled (fuel should remain at initial level)\n5. Plane3 should never be refueled (fuel should remain at initial level)\n\nActually, let me look at the initial state:\n- plane1 is located at city4 with fuel 205\n- plane2 is located at city2 with fuel 1469  \n- plane3 is located at city3 with fuel 1532\n\nSo the constraints should be:\n1. No person should ever be inside plane2\n2. No person should ever be inside plane3\n3. Plane2 should always remain located at city2\n\n\n4. Plane3 should always remain located at city3\n5. Plane2's fuel should always remain at 1469\n6. Plane3's fuel should always remain at 1532\n\nI'll distill the core requirements into three fundamental principles. These principles ensure plane1 is the sole active aircraft while plane2 and plane3 remain completely static. The goal is to create a strict operational boundary that isolates plane1 as the exclusive transportation resource.\n\nThe key constraints transform the problem's mobility and operational scope, effectively creating a single-aircraft transportation scenario that limits all movement and interactions to plane1 exclusively."

Plane3's fuel level should always remain at its initial value of 1532\n</constraints>\n\n<explanation>\nI decomposed the \"Only use plane1\" constraint into six complementary state-based constraints that ensure plane2 and plane3 remain completely unused. The first two constraints prevent any passengers from boarding these planes, while the location constraints ensure they never move, and the fuel constraints ensure they are never refueled.\n</explanation>"
