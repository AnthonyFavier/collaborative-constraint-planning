The constraint is: \"The rock sample must always remain at waypoint6 throughout the entire mission\"\n\nLet me analyze this:\n1. This is about a rock sample that should always remain at waypoint6\n2. The word \"always\" indicates this is a temporal logic constraint that must hold throughout the entire execution\n3. In PDDL3.0, temporal logic constraints use operators like \"always\", \"sometime\", \"at-most-once\", etc.\n4. I need to look at the domain to see what predicate represents a rock sample being at a waypoint\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate:\n(at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint)\n\nAnd in the problem file, I can see:\n(at_rock_sample waypoint6)\n\nSo the rock sample is initially at waypoint6.\n\nThe constraint should be that (at_rock_sample waypoint6) must always be true throughout the mission.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, the \"always\" temporal logic operator is used for constraints that must hold throughout the entire execution.\n\nThe syntax would be:\n(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))\n\nThis means that the predicate (at_rock_sample waypoint6) must be true in every state during the execution."

There's a rock sample at waypoint6: `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)`\n2. Rock samples can be collected using the `samplerock` action\n3. When a rock sample is collected, the predicate `(at_rock_sample ?p)` becomes false (it's removed)\n4. The rovers that can potentially collect rock samples are those equipped for rock analysis: rover0, rover2, and rover3\n\nThe constraint needs to be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic. I can't directly reference the `samplerock` action, but I can reference the state changes that result from that action.\n\nThe key insight is that if the rock sample at waypoint6 should never be collected, then the predicate `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` should always remain true throughout the execution.\n\nIn Linear Temporal Logic terms, this would be: G(at_rock_sample waypoint6) - meaning \"globally/always, the rock sample is at waypoint6\"\n\nSince I need to avoid PDDL language, I should phrase this in natural language that captures the same meaning.\n\nLet me think about this constraint:\n- The rock sample should always remain at waypoint6\n- No rover should ever pick up the rock sample from waypoint6\n- The rock sample at waypoint6 should be preserved throughout the mission\n\nI think the most direct way to express this is: \"The rock sample must always remain at waypoint6\" - this captures that the sample should never be removed/collected.\n\nActually, let me be more precise. The constraint is that the rock sample should never be collected, which means it should always be present at waypoint6. In the PDDL domain, when a rock sample is collected, the `(at_rock_sample ?p)` predicate is removed, so the constraint is that this predicate should always remain true for waypoint6.\n \nI've carefully considered the constraint's precise formulation. The statement is straightforward and unambiguous, directly specifying the requirement that the rock sample must permanently stay at its current location. No further refinement is needed to capture the intent of preserving the sample's position throughout the mission."
