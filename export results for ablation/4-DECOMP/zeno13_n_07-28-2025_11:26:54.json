So I need to think about this differently.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the function `(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)`, this tracks debarkations of person ?p from aircraft ?a in city ?c. But the constraint is about the total number of times person ?p has been debarked in city ?c from ANY aircraft.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as a state-based constraint using the `always` temporal operator. The constraint should state that for any person ?p and any city ?c, the sum of all `(n_debark ?p ?a ?c)` over all aircraft ?a should never exceed 1.\n\nLet me think about how to express this sum. In PDDL3.0, I can use arithmetic expressions. I need to sum over all aircraft for a given person and city.\n\nLooking at the domain again, the objects include plane1, plane2, plane3 as aircraft. So for a person ?p and city ?c, I need to ensure:\n(n_debark ?p plane1 ?c) + (n_debark ?p plane2 ?c) + (n_debark ?p plane3 ?c) <= 1\n\nBut this is specific to this problem instance. For a general constraint, I need to think differently.\n\n\nI recognize the need for a more generalized approach that works across all possible aircraft. The solution requires a universal quantifier to create a flexible constraint that applies to any set of aircraft in the domain.\n\nThe key is to create a constraint that sums debarkations across all possible aircraft for a specific person and city, ensuring the total never exceeds one. This means no person can be debarked more than once in any single city, regardless of the aircraft involved.\n\nThe PDDL3.0 formulation needs careful construction to handle variable aircraft counts while maintaining the core logical requirement of unique city debarking.\n\nI'll specify a constraint ensuring no person debarks more than once across all aircraft in any given city. The constraint uses forall quantification over persons and cities, summing debarkation counts to enforce the one-debarking rule.\n\nThe key is tracking each person's city debarking across multiple aircraft, preventing multiple disembarkations in the same location. By limiting the total debarkations to 1, I ensure precise movement tracking in the planning domain."

The action has the effect of making the person `(located ?p ?c)` where ?p is the person and ?c is the city.\n\nThe constraint means that for any person, they should not be debarked (i.e., end up being located) in the same city more than once during the execution of the plan.\n\nLooking at the domain, there's also a function `(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)` which seems to count the number of times a person has been debarked from an aircraft in a specific city.\n\nHowever, I need to think about this more carefully. The constraint is about state-based conditions, not actions directly. So I need to think about what states would violate this constraint.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The constraint is about the number of times a person is debarked in the same city. Since this is about trajectory constraints and needs to be state-based, I need to think about how to express this in terms of states.\n\nLooking at the domain again, there's a function `n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city` that gets incremented each time a person is debarked. This seems to track exactly what we need.\n\nSo the constraint should be: for any person p and city c, the value of n_debark(p, a, c) summed over all aircraft a should never exceed 1.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this more carefully. The function n_debark is specific to a person, aircraft, and city combination. So if person1 is debarked from plane1 in city1, that increments n_debark(person1, plane1, city1). \n\nI realize the complexity involves tracking multiple aircraft debarks in the same city. If the same person debarks from different planes in the same city, the tracking becomes nuanced. The total number of debarks for a person in a specific city needs careful consideration across all possible aircraft.\n\nThe key challenge is ensuring the constraint captures the total city-based debark count, not just per-aircraft debarks. I'll need a mechanism to aggregate these individual debark counts.\n\nMy focus narrows to the specific debark action, distinguishing it from initial city location. The constraint centers on preventing multiple debark events for a single person in one city, regardless of the aircraft involved.\n\nI recognize this as a fundamental rule ensuring each person can only be debarked once per city location. The tracking mechanism uses the n_debark function, which increments with each debark action, providing a clear way to enforce this single-event limitation.\n\nThe core principle remains straightforward: a person cannot be debarked more than once in the same city across all possible aircraft movements.\n\nThis constraint provides a clean, unambiguous way to prevent redundant or impossible debark scenarios in the travel domain."
