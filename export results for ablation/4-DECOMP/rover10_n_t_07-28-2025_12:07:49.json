The constraint is about the rock sample at waypoint6 remaining present throughout the entire mission.\n\n2. Looking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint)` which indicates that there's a rock sample at waypoint `?w`.\n\n3. In the initial state, I can see `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` is true.\n\n4. The constraint says this must \"always\" remain true throughout the entire mission.\n\n5. In PDDL3.0, temporal logic operators include:\n   - `always` - something must be true in all states\n   - `sometime` - something must be true in at least one state\n   - `at-most-once` - something can be true at most once\n   - `sometime-after` - something must be true sometime after another condition\n   - `sometime-before` - something must be true sometime before another condition\n   - `always-within` - something must always be true within a time window\n   - etc.\n\n6. Since the constraint says the rock sample \"must always remain present\", this sounds like I need to use the `always` operator.\n\n7. The constraint would be: `(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))`\n\nThis means that in all states of the plan, the predicate `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` must be true."

When a rock sample is collected through the `samplerock` action, the effect includes `(not (at_rock_sample ?p))` where ?p is the waypoint.\n\nSo the constraint in natural language would be that the rock sample must always remain at waypoint6 - it should never be removed/collected.\n\nSince I need to avoid explicit PDDL language and make it state-based following Linear Temporal Logic, I should phrase this as:\n\n1. The rock sample at waypoint6 must always remain available at that location throughout the entire mission.\n\nThis captures the essence that the rock sample should never be collected. I could also phrase it as:\n\n1. Throughout the entire mission execution, there must always be a rock sample present at waypoint6.\n\nOr I could be more specific:\n\n1. The rock sample at waypoint6 must never be removed or collected by any rover.\n\nI think the clearest way is to state it as the rock sample always remaining available/present at waypoint6.\n\nLet me think if this needs to be decomposed into multiple constraints. The user constraint is quite simple and specific - it's about one specific rock sample at one specific waypoint never being collected. I don't think this needs to be decomposed into multiple constraints since it's already very specific and clear.\n \nI'll formulate the constraint to emphasize the rock sample's persistent presence at waypoint6, ensuring it remains untouched throughout the mission's duration. The key is maintaining the sample's location as an invariant condition, preventing any rover from collecting or moving it."
