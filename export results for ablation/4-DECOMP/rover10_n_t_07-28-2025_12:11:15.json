Let me think about the structure:\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate:\n(have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint)\n\nSo the constraint is saying:\n- Until (some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1), no rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0\n\nIn PDDL3.0 temporal logic, this can be expressed as:\n(until (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1))\n       (forall (?r - rover) (not (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint0))))\n\nBut let me double-check the PDDL3.0 syntax. Actually, I think the more standard way would be:\n\n(until (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1))\n       (not (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint0))))\n\nThis reads as: \"Until there exists some rover that has rock analysis from waypoint1, it should not be the case that there exists any rover that has rock analysis from waypoint0.\"\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The constraint \"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\" can be interpreted as:\n\n- It should always be the case that if no rover has rock analysis from waypoint1, then no rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0\n\nThis could be expressed as:\n(always (imply (not (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1)))\n               (not (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint0)))))\n\nI prefer the until operator as it more directly captures the temporal dependency between waypoint1 and waypoint0 rock analyses. The constraint ensures that rock analysis at waypoint0 is only permitted after at least one rover has completed analysis at waypoint1."

I need to think about how to express this temporal constraint using standard PDDL3.0 constructs.\n\nLooking at PDDL3.0, the temporal logic operators that are typically supported include:\n- always\n- sometime\n- at-most-once\n- sometime-after\n- sometime-before\n- at-end\n- over-all\n- within\n\nThe constraint is: \"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\"\n\nThis means:\n- Before any rover gets rock analysis from waypoint1, no rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0\n- This is essentially saying that having rock analysis from waypoint0 should only happen after having rock analysis from waypoint1\n\nI think this can be expressed using \"sometime-before\":\n- For any rover that has rock analysis from waypoint0, there should sometime before have been a rover that has rock analysis from waypoint1\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The constraint is about ordering - waypoint1 rock analysis must come before waypoint0 rock analysis.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I think the correct way would be to use \"always\" with an implication:\n\n(always (imply (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint0))\n               (exists (?r2 - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r2 waypoint1))))\n\nThis says: \"It should always be the case that if there exists a rover with rock analysis from waypoint0, then there exists a rover with rock analysis from waypoint1.\"\n\nBut this doesn't capture the temporal ordering - it just says they should both exist at the same time.\n\nLet me try \"sometime-before\":\nFor every rover that gets rock analysis from waypoint0, there should sometime before have been rock analysis from waypoint1.\n\nActually, I think the constraint might be better expressed as:\n\n\n- It should always be the case that if no rover has rock analysis from waypoint1 yet, then no rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0\n\nI'll formalize this temporal constraint using PDDL's logical operators to ensure a strict sequential dependency between rock analyses at different waypoints. The key is creating a logical rule that prevents waypoint0 analysis until waypoint1 has been analyzed, maintaining a clear order of exploration.\n\nThe PDDL expression precisely captures the temporal constraint by using an implication that blocks waypoint0 rock analysis when waypoint1 remains unanalyzed. This approach ensures a systematic and controlled exploration sequence for the rovers."

The \"until\" operator in PDDL3.0 has the form:\n(until \u03c6 \u03c8)\n\nThis means \u03c8 must hold until \u03c6 becomes true.\n\nSo in our case:\n- \u03c6 (the condition that releases the constraint): some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\n- \u03c8 (what must hold until \u03c6): no rover has rock analysis from waypoint4\n\nSo it would be:\n(until (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1))\n       (forall (?r - rover) (not (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint4))))\n\nLet me double-check this interpretation:\n- \"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint4\" - this is the condition that must hold\n\n\n- \"until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\" - this is the releasing condition\n\nI see the temporal logic ensures that rock analysis at waypoint4 is prohibited until a specific milestone is reached at waypoint1.

I need to think about how to express this temporal constraint in standard PDDL3.0.\n\nThe constraint is: \"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint4 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\"\n\nIn PDDL3.0, we have temporal logic operators like:\n- always\n- sometime \n- at-most-once\n- sometime-after\n- sometime-before\n- always-within\n\nThe constraint seems to be saying that having rock analysis from waypoint1 must precede having rock analysis from waypoint4. This sounds like a \"sometime-before\" constraint.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- We want: if any rover has rock analysis from waypoint4, then before that point, some rover must have had rock analysis from waypoint1\n\nThis could be expressed as:\n(forall (?r - rover) \n  (imply (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint4)\n         (sometime-before (exists (?r2 - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r2 waypoint1)) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint4))))\n\nBut that's a bit circular since we're using the same predicate in the condition and the consequence.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The constraint could be expressed as:\n\n(always (imply (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint4))\n               (exists (?r2 - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r2 waypoint1))))\n\nThis says: at all times, if any rover has rock analysis from waypoint4, then some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1.\n\nBut this doesn't capture the temporal ordering properly. Let me try another approach.\n\nActually, I think the right way is:\n(forall (?r - rover)\n  (sometime-before (exists (?r2 - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r2 waypoint1))\n                   (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint4)))\n\nI see a potential issue with quantification. The nested quantifiers might create complexity in expressing the precise temporal constraint. The goal is to ensure rock analysis from waypoint1 occurs before any rock analysis from waypoint4, but the syntax needs careful refinement to capture this temporal dependency accurately.\n\nThe challenge lies in precisely defining the sequence of rock analysis events across different waypoints while maintaining logical consistency in the PDDL3.0 temporal logic framework.\n\nI'll explore temporal operators that can more explicitly represent the required ordering constraint between waypoint events.\n\nThe key insight"

The original constraint is:\n\"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint6 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\"\n\nThis means:\n- As long as no rover has rock analysis from waypoint1, no rover should have rock analysis from waypoint6\n- Once some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1, then rovers can have rock analysis from waypoint6\n \nThe temporal logic precisely captures the sequential dependency between rock analyses at different waypoints. I'll formalize this as a \"sometime-before\" constraint to ensure the correct order of rock sample collection across waypoints."

I need to use standard PDDL3.0 temporal constraint keywords. \n\nThe constraint \"No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint6 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\" means that having rock analysis from waypoint1 must happen before having rock analysis from waypoint6.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this can be expressed using the `sometime-before` temporal operator:\n\n<pddl>\n(sometime-before (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1)) \n                 (exists (?r - rover) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint6)))\n</pddl>"

The constraint should ensure that rock analysis at waypoint1 happens before rock analysis at any other waypoint.\n2. Since we're dealing with states, I need to think about when a rover has rock analysis from different waypoints.\n3. The constraint should be that no rover should have rock analysis from waypoints 0, 3, 4, or 6 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1.\n\nLooking at the domain, the predicate (have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint) indicates that a rover has rock analysis from a waypoint.\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n- Until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1, no rover should have rock analysis from waypoints 0, 3, 4, or 6.\n\nIn natural language, this could be expressed as:\n1. No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint0 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\n2. No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint3 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1  \n3. No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint4 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\n4. No rover should have rock analysis from waypoint6 until some rover has rock analysis from waypoint1\n\n\n5. The rock analysis at waypoint1 must precede analyses at other waypoints in the mission sequence.\n\nI'll refine the temporal constraint to precisely capture the order of rock sampling. The key is ensuring waypoint1's analysis occurs before analyses at waypoints 0, 3, 4, and 6, creating a strict sequential requirement for the rover's scientific exploration."

This captures the user's intent that waypoint1 rock analysis should have priority over all other rock sampling activities.\n</explanation>"
