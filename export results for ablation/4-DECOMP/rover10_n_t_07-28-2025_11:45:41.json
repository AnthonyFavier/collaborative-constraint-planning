This means that for all waypoints, the predicate `(have_rock_analysis rover2 ?w)` should never be true.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, to express \"never\" we use the temporal logic operator `always`. And to express \"for any waypoint\" we need to use universal quantification.\n\nSo the constraint should be:\n`(always (forall (?w - waypoint) (not (have_rock_analysis rover2 ?w))))`\n\nThis reads as: \"Always, for all waypoints w, it is not the case that rover2 has rock analysis data from waypoint w.\"\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- \"Rover2 must never\" \u2192 `always (not ...)`\n- \"have rock analysis data from any waypoint\" \u2192 `(have_rock_analysis rover2 ?w)` for any waypoint\n- \"any waypoint\" \u2192 universal quantification `(forall (?w - waypoint) ...)`\n\nSo the complete constraint is:\n`(always (forall (?w - waypoint) (not (have_rock_analysis rover2 ?w))))`"

This is about rover2 specifically\n2. It's about image data \n3. It should never have image data for any objective in any mode\n4. This is a temporal constraint - \"never\" implies always not\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(have_image ?r - rover ?o - objective ?m - mode)` that indicates when a rover has image data for an objective in a specific mode.\n\nSo the constraint should be that rover2 never has this predicate true for any objective and any mode.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, temporal logic operators include:\n- `always` - something must be true throughout the entire execution\n- `sometime` - something must be true at some point\n- `never` - something must never be true (equivalent to `always (not ...)`)\n\nSo I need to express that for all objectives and all modes, rover2 never has image data.\n\nThe constraint would be:\n`(always (forall (?o - objective ?m - mode) (not (have_image rover2 ?o ?m))))`\n\nActually, let me double-check the syntax. In PDDL3.0, the temporal operators work with state formulas. The `always` operator means the formula must be true in all states.\n\nSo the constraint is:\n`(always (forall (?o - objective ?m - mode) (not (have_image rover2 ?o ?m))))`\n\nThis means: \"In all states throughout the execution, for all objectives o and all modes m, rover2 does not have image data for objective o in mode m.\""

The constraint should be:\n\n`(always (not (calibrated camera4 ?r)))`\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful about the quantification. Since we want this to hold for any rover, I need to make sure that camera4 is never calibrated with any rover.\n\nLooking at the problem file, I can see that camera4 is on board rover2:\n`(on_board camera4 rover2)`\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n`(always (not (calibrated camera4 rover2)))`\n\nBut actually, to be more general and capture the meaning that camera4 should never be calibrated with any rover, I should use:\n\n`(always (forall (?r - rover) (not (calibrated camera4 ?r))))`\n\nHowever, let me double-check if PDDL3.0 supports `forall` in constraints. Actually, in this specific case, since camera4 is only on board rover2, I can be more specific:\n\n`(always (not (calibrated camera4 rover2)))`\n\nThis captures the constraint that camera4 must never be calibrated."

Let me analyze this constraint and think about what it means in the context of the rover domain.\n\nIn this rover domain, a rover being \"used\" would mean that it performs actions. However, the constraint needs to be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, so I can't directly refer to actions.\n\nLooking at the PDDL domain, I can see that rovers have various properties and can be in different states:\n- They have a location (in ?rover ?waypoint)\n- They have energy levels\n- They can be available or not available\n- They can have analysis data (have_rock_analysis, have_soil_analysis)\n- They can have images (have_image)\n- Their stores can be empty or full\n- They can have cameras calibrated\n\nIf rover2 should never be used, that means:\n1. It should never move from its initial location\n2. It should never collect any samples (rock or soil analysis)\n3. It should never take any images\n4. Its store should remain empty (since sampling would fill it)\n5. Its cameras should never be calibrated (since that would be part of using it for imaging)\n\nLet me check the initial state of rover2:\n- rover2 starts at waypoint3\n- rover2 has energy 50\n- rover2 is available\n- rover2store is empty\n- rover2 is equipped for rock analysis and imaging\n- rover2 has camera4 on board\n\nSo the constraints should ensure that:\n1. Rover2 always remains at waypoint3 (its initial location)\n2. Rover2 never has any rock analysis data\n3. Rover2 never has any image data\n4. Rover2's store (rover2store) always remains empty\n5. Camera4 (which is on rover2) is never calibrated\n\nLet me formulate these as state-based constraints:\n\n\nI'll define precise restrictions to completely immobilize rover2, preventing any meaningful action while maintaining its initial state. These constraints create a total lockdown, ensuring the rover remains inactive throughout the entire mission."

Camera4 must never be calibrated\n</constraints>\n\n<explanation>\nI decomposed the constraint into five complementary state-based conditions that together ensure rover2 remains completely unused. These cover location (preventing movement), sample collection (preventing rock analysis), imaging (preventing image capture and camera calibration), and storage (preventing any sampling activity that would fill the store).\n</explanation>"
