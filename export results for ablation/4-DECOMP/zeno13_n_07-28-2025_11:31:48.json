There's a `refuel` action that sets fuel to capacity: `(assign (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a))`\n2. There's a predicate `(located ?x - locatable ?c - city)` to check location\n3. There's a function `(fuel ?a - aircraft)` for current fuel\n4. There's a function `(capacity ?a - aircraft)` for maximum capacity\n\nThe constraint says that if an aircraft is located in city2, then it cannot have its fuel equal to its capacity.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be a state constraint. The constraint needs to express that for any aircraft, if it's located in city2, then its fuel cannot be equal to its capacity.\n\nThis can be written as:\n- For all aircraft ?a, if (located ?a city2) then NOT (= (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a))\n\nIn PDDL3.0 syntax, this would be:\n```\n(forall (?a - aircraft) \n  (imply (located ?a city2) \n         (not (= (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a)))))\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check the PDDL3.0 syntax for constraints. In PDDL3.0, state constraints are typically written using `always` or other temporal operators.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, the constraint is about preventing the state where an aircraft in city2 has full fuel. This is a state constraint that should always hold.\n\nThe PDDL3.0 way to express this would be:\n```\n(always (forall (?a - aircraft) \n           (imply (located ?a city2) \n                  (not (= (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a))))))\n\n\n```\n\nI'll formalize the constraint to ensure aircraft in city2 maintain a fuel level below full capacity. The key is using the `always` temporal operator to create a persistent rule preventing complete refueling in this specific location."

The constraint is saying that this refuel action should not be allowed when the aircraft is in city2.\n\nIn PDDL terms, this would mean that whenever an aircraft is located in city2, it cannot perform the refuel action. But I need to express this in natural language without using PDDL terminology.\n\nThe constraint is essentially saying that:\n- No aircraft should refuel while located in city2\n\nSince constraints must be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, I need to think about this in terms of states rather than actions. \n\nThe refuel action in PDDL has the effect of setting the fuel of an aircraft to its capacity. So if I want to prevent refueling in city2, I need to ensure that:\n- If an aircraft is in city2, its fuel level should not suddenly jump to its maximum capacity (which would indicate refueling occurred)\n\nBut this is tricky to express as a state constraint. Let me think of another approach.\n\nActually, looking at the PDDL domain more carefully, the refuel action increases a counter \"n_refuel\" each time it's used. So I could constrain that:\n- The refuel counter for any aircraft should not increase while that aircraft is located in city2\n\nBut again, this is referencing the action indirectly.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The user wants to prevent refueling in city2. In terms of states, this means:\n- No plane should ever have its fuel restored to full capacity while located in city2\n\nOr more precisely:\n- If a plane is located in city2, it should not have its fuel level increase to its maximum capacity\n\nBut this is still quite complex to express as a state constraint.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The user constraint is about preventing the refuel action from happening in city2. \n\nI'll focus on a clear, straightforward interpretation of the constraint. Aircraft in city2 cannot increase their fuel levels. This means when a plane is in city2, its fuel should remain constant - no additional fuel can be added. The key is preventing any fuel gain while the aircraft is located in this specific city.\n\nThe constraint fundamentally restricts fuel replenishment in city2, ensuring that planes cannot restore or increase their fuel levels while present in this location. I want to prevent refueling in city2 by ensuring aircraft cannot restore their fuel to full capacity while located there. The core constraint is blocking the transition from partial to maximum fuel levels during an aircraft's stay in this location. Essentially, city2 lacks the infrastructure to support complete fuel replenishment, maintaining aircraft at their current or reduced fuel states. I'm exploring state-based constraints to prevent refueling in city2. The core requirement is maintaining the current fuel state of aircraft while they're located in this specific city. Essentially, any aircraft in city2 should not experience fuel level increases or complete refueling. The constraint focuses on preserving the existing fuel quantity, ensuring no restoration to maximum capacity occurs during the aircraft's stay in city2.\n\nThe key principle is preventing fuel-related state changes that would artificially improve an aircraft's fuel status. This means keeping the fuel level static and blocking any mechanisms that might artificially replenish or maximize fuel reserves while the aircraft remains in this location. I'll track the refueling counter to prevent aircraft from replenishing fuel while in city2. The key is ensuring no fuel restoration occurs for planes at this location, maintaining the constraint that city2 lacks fuel resources. This single rule effectively blocks refueling operations, directly addressing the user's specification about fuel unavailability in the specific city."
