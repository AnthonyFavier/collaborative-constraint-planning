Let me think about what this means.\n\nThis constraint is saying that in the solution, only plane1 should be used for transportation. This means that plane2 and plane3 should not be used.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as a state-based constraint. Since it says \"only use plane1\", this means that plane2 and plane3 should not perform any actions.\n\nLooking at the domain, the actions that aircraft can perform are:\n- board (people can board the aircraft)\n- debark (people can debark from the aircraft)  \n- flyslow (aircraft flies slowly)\n- flyfast (aircraft flies fast)\n- refuel (aircraft refuels)\n\nTo ensure \"only plane1\" is used, I need to make sure that plane2 and plane3 don't perform any of these actions.\n\nHowever, PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based, not action-based. So I can't directly say \"don't perform action X with plane2\". Instead, I need to think about what states would indicate that plane2 or plane3 have been used.\n\nLooking at the domain, there are some functions that track action usage:\n- (n_board ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_refuel ?a - aircraft)\n\nThese functions count how many times each action has been performed. To ensure \"only plane1\" is used, I can constrain that these counters for plane2 and plane3 remain at 0.\n\nSince these are functions (not predicates), I need to use the \"=\" operator to check their values.\n\n\nI'll construct a comprehensive constraint that ensures plane2 and plane3 remain unused by checking all their action counters are zero across different action types and parameters.\n\nThis means creating a global constraint that checks zero usage for every possible action involving plane2 and plane3, covering boarding, debarking, flying, and refueling scenarios.\n\nUsing PDDL3.0's universal quantification and temporal operators, I can elegantly express this constraint to guarantee these planes are completely inactive throughout the entire plan execution.\n\nThe constraint will systematically verify zero counts for all potential actions and parameters, ensuring strict adherence to the \"Only use plane1\" requirement.\n\nThis means comprehensively checking boarding, debarking, flying, and refueling actions for both plane2 and plane3, with zero permitted interactions across all possible city and person combinations."
