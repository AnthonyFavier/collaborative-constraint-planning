The constraint is about never collecting a rock sample at waypoint6\n2. In the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint)` that indicates there's a rock sample at a waypoint\n3. Looking at the `samplerock` action, I can see that when a rock sample is collected, the effect includes `(not (at_rock_sample ?p))` where ?p is the waypoint\n\nSo if a rock sample at waypoint6 should never be collected, it means that `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` should always remain true throughout the execution.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, temporal logic constraints can be expressed using operators like `always`, `sometime`, `at-most-once`, etc.\n\nSince we want the rock sample to never be collected, we want `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` to always be true. So the constraint would be:\n\n`(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))`\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- `(always \u03c6)` means that \u03c6 is true in all states of the plan\n- We want the rock sample at waypoint6 to never be collected\n- This means `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` should remain true throughout the plan\n- So `(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))` captures this requirement correctly\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. In the initial state, I see:\n```\n(at_rock_sample waypoint6)\n```\n\nSo initially there is a rock sample at waypoint6. The constraint says this should never be collected. If it's never collected, then `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` should always remain true.\n\nYes, `(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))` is the correct translation."
