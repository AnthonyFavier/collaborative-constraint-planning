So I need to think about this differently.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the domain, the refuel action doesn't have any location-based preconditions explicitly. It just checks if the fuel is less than capacity. \n\nBut the constraint \"planes can't refuel at city2\" means that whenever a plane is at city2, it should not be able to refuel. \n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can express this as:\n```\n(always (forall (?a - aircraft) \n    (imply (located ?a city2) \n        (= (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a)))))\n```\n\nThis would mean that whenever an aircraft is at city2, its fuel must always equal its capacity (i.e., it's always full), which would prevent refueling since the refuel action requires fuel < capacity.\n \nI'm exploring alternative approaches to represent the constraint more precisely. The goal is to ensure that when an aircraft is at city2, refueling becomes impossible. I'll examine different ways to capture this state-based restriction in PDDL3.0, focusing on the relationship between location and fuel capacity.\n\nMy current strategy involves carefully crafting a constraint that prevents refueling at city2 without overly restricting the problem's solvability. I'm considering the nuanced interactions between aircraft location, fuel levels, and refueling preconditions.\n\nThe challenge is to create a constraint that effectively communicates the \"out of fuel\" status of city2 without making the entire scenario infeasible.\n\nBy specifying that aircraft at city2 must always have fuel at maximum capacity, I'm directly implementing the constraint that refueling becomes impossible in this location. This approach ensures the fuel constraint is clear and unambiguous while maintaining the logical integrity of the problem's design."
