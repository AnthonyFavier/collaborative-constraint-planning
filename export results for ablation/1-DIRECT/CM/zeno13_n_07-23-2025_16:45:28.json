In PDDL3.0, this can be expressed using the `always` temporal operator.\n\nThe constraint should be:\n`(always (located plane2 city2))`\n\nThis ensures that throughout the entire execution of the plan, plane2 remains located at city2, which effectively prevents it from moving.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- `always` is a PDDL3.0 temporal logic operator\n- `(located plane2 city2)` is a valid predicate from the domain\n- This constraint captures the meaning that plane2 should never move from its initial location\n\nYes, this looks correct."
