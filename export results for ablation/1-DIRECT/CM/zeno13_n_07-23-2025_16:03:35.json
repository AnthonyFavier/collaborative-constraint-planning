The constraint \"Only use plane1\" means that plane2 and plane3 should not be used.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints are state-based and can refer to predicates and fluents. To express that only plane1 should be used, I need to ensure that plane2 and plane3 don't perform any actions.\n\nLooking at the domain, the actions that planes can perform are:\n- board (when a person boards a plane)\n- debark (when a person debarks from a plane) \n- flyslow (when a plane flies slowly)\n- flyfast (when a plane flies fast)\n- refuel (when a plane refuels)\n\nEach of these actions has counter fluents that track how many times they've been performed:\n- n_board\n- n_debark  \n- n_flyslow\n- n_flyfast\n- n_refuel\n\nTo ensure only plane1 is used, I need to constrain that these counter fluents for plane2 and plane3 remain at 0 throughout the execution.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can use the always constraint with equality to ensure these fluents never increase from 0.\n\nLet me check the fluent definitions:\n- (n_board ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city) \n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_refuel ?a - aircraft)\n\nFor plane2 and plane3, I need to ensure all these counters remain 0.\n\nFor n_board and n_debark, these are parameterized by person, aircraft, and city. For plane2 and plane3, I need to ensure these are 0 for all combinations.\n \nI'll use forall quantifiers to constrain the fluent counters for plane2 and plane3 across all possible parameter combinations. This ensures these planes remain completely unused throughout the entire plan execution. The constraint will systematically prevent plane2 and plane3 from participating in any actions by keeping their action counters permanently at zero.\n\nThe constraint covers boarding, debarking, flying (both slow and fast), and refueling for both planes, effectively rendering them inactive in the transportation domain."
