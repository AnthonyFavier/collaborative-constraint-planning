The constraint is that plane2 should never move. In the domain, planes move by using the actions `flyslow` and `flyfast`. These actions change the location of the aircraft.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as a state-based constraint. The constraint should say that plane2 should always remain in its initial location.\n\nLooking at the problem, plane2 is initially located in city2:\n```\n(located plane2 city2)\n```\n\nSo the constraint should be that plane2 should always be located in city2. In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed using the `always` operator:\n\n```\n(always (located plane2 city2))\n```\n\nThis means that throughout the entire execution, plane2 must be located in city2, which effectively prevents it from moving.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning:\n- If plane2 is always located in city2, then it cannot be located anywhere else\n- The actions that could move plane2 are `flyslow` and `flyfast`\n- Both of these actions have the effect `(not (located ?a ?c1))` and `(located ?a ?c2)` where ?c1 is the origin and ?c2 is the destination\n- If we require that plane2 is always located in city2, then these actions cannot be applied to plane2 with any origin other than city2, and they cannot have any destination other than city2\n- Since the distance from city2 to city2 is 0, and the actions would require fuel consumption based on distance, the actions would essentially do nothing (move from city2 to city2)\n- But more importantly, the constraint would prevent any meaningful movement\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The `always` constraint means that the condition must hold in every state throughout the execution. So `(always (located plane2 city2))` means that in every state, plane2 must be located in city2. This would indeed prevent plane2 from moving to any other city."
