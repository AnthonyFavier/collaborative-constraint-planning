This is a state-based constraint.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can use the `always` temporal operator to express that this should hold throughout the execution.\n\nThe constraint should be:\n- If person1 is in some aircraft, then person3 should be in the same aircraft\n- If person3 is in some aircraft, then person1 should be in the same aircraft\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n```\n(always (forall (?a - aircraft) \n  (imply (in person1 ?a) (in person3 ?a))))\n```\n\nAnd also:\n```\n(always (forall (?a - aircraft) \n  (imply (in person3 ?a) (in person1 ?a))))\n```\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. \"Travel together\" could mean:\n1. They are always in the same aircraft when either is in an aircraft\n2. They board and debark together\n\nFor the first interpretation, I need to ensure that:\n- If person1 is in any aircraft, person3 is in the same aircraft\n- If person3 is in any aircraft, person1 is in the same aircraft\n\nThis can be expressed more concisely as:\n\n\nI'll use a bidirectional constraint to ensure both persons are always in the same aircraft simultaneously. The `iff` (if and only if) operator captures the essence of traveling together perfectly. This means for any aircraft, person1 is present if and only if person3 is present, creating a strict synchronization of their movements."
