In the refuel action, this counter is increased: `(increase (n_refuel ?a) 1)`.\n\nSo to express \"Plane2 should never refuel\", I can use the constraint that the number of refuels for plane2 should always be 0.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints are typically expressed using the `always` temporal operator for something that should hold throughout the execution.\n\nThe constraint would be:\n`(always (= (n_refuel plane2) 0))`\n\nThis means that at all times during the execution, the number of refuels for plane2 should be 0, which effectively prevents plane2 from ever refueling."
