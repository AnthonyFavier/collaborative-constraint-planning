The constraint \"Rover2 should never be used\" means that rover2 should never perform any actions.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints are state-based and can use temporal logic operators. Since this is a \"never\" constraint, I need to use the \"always\" temporal operator to express that throughout the entire plan execution, rover2 should remain unused.\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(available ?r - rover)` which indicates when a rover is available. In the initial state, rover2 is available: `(available rover2)`.\n\nWhen rovers perform actions, they typically remain available (looking at the actions, most of them maintain the `(available ?r)` condition in their effects or don't change it). However, the key insight is that if rover2 is never used, it should always remain in its initial state.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The constraint \"Rover2 should never be used\" means that rover2 should never perform any actions. In PDDL, we can't directly refer to actions in constraints, but we can refer to the effects of actions.\n\nLooking at the domain, I notice that rover2 has the following initial properties:\n- `(in rover2 waypoint3)` - it starts at waypoint3\n- `(available rover2)` - it's available\n- `(store_of rover2store rover2)` - it has a store\n- `(empty rover2store)` - its store is empty\n- Energy level: `(= (energy rover2) 50)`\n\nIf rover2 is never used, then:\n1. It should always remain at waypoint3\n2. Its store should always remain empty\n3. Its energy should never change from 50\n\nThe most straightforward way to express this is to say that rover2 should always remain at waypoint3, since if it moves, it would have been used.\n\n\nI'll use the `always` temporal operator to constrain rover2's location. This ensures that throughout the entire plan execution, rover2 remains at waypoint3, effectively preventing it from being used in any action that would require movement.\n\nThe constraint will prevent rover2 from participating in actions like navigate, sample collection, or any other movement-based tasks, thus meeting the requirement of never being used.\n\nMost rover actions depend on being at specific waypoints. While some actions like recharge or sampling could potentially occur at waypoint3, the rigid location constraint significantly limits the rover's utility.\n\nThe core goal is preventing rover2 from performing any actions by maintaining its initial state. This means preserving its precise location, energy level, and empty storage condition throughout the entire mission timeline.\n\nSpecifically, the key state constraints involve keeping rover2 permanently at waypoint3, maintaining its full 50-unit energy reserve, and ensuring its storage remains completely empty.\n\nThe most straightforward constraint would simply mandate that rover2 never leaves its initial waypoint, effectively neutralizing its potential mission contributions while technically satisfying the requirement of non-usage.\n\nAt waypoint3, rover2 technically has several potential actions like sampling soil or rock, or recharging, but the constraint would systematically block these possibilities by preventing any state changes.\n\nBy maintaining rover2 at waypoint3 with a fixed energy level and an empty store, I can comprehensively prevent its involvement in any meaningful mission tasks. This multi-faceted constraint ensures the rover remains completely inactive throughout the planning process.\n\nThe energy constraint proves particularly powerful, as it fundamentally blocks all potential actions. Since every rover operation consumes energy except recharging, keeping the energy constant effectively immobilizes the rover.\n\nI'll focus on a single, elegant constraint that prevents rover2 from performing any mission-critical operations at this critical waypoint.\n\nThe recharge action's specific preconditions - requiring both being in a sunlit location and having energy below 80 - further reinforce my strategy. At waypoint3, these conditions cannot be met, which means rover2 remains completely inactive.\n\nBy maintaining rover2's energy at a constant 50, I've engineered a comprehensive mechanism to ensure zero movement or interaction with the environment.\n\nThe constraint systematically prevents rover2 from performing any actions through three critical limitations: energy-consuming actions are blocked, recharging is impossible, and navigation would require energy expenditure, creating an absolute operational lockdown."

Since PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based, I need to constrain the states that would result from rover2 being used.\n\nThe most effective way to ensure rover2 is never used is to constrain its energy level to remain constant at its initial value. Since all actions (except recharge) decrease energy, and recharge is not possible at rover2's location (waypoint3 is not in sun), keeping rover2's energy constant at 50 ensures it never performs any actions.\n\n<pddl>\n(always (= (energy rover2) 50))\n</pddl>"
