The constraint is saying that person7, plane2, and plane3 should be ignored. In the context of planning, this likely means that these entities should not be used in the solution - they should remain in their initial state throughout the entire plan execution.\n\nLooking at the domain and problem:\n\n1. person7 is initially located at city0\n2. plane2 is initially located at city2 with certain fuel, capacity, etc.\n3. plane3 is initially located at city3 with certain fuel, capacity, etc.\n\nFor these to be \"ignored\", they should not participate in any actions. This means:\n\nFor person7:\n- person7 should not board any aircraft\n- person7 should not debark from any aircraft (though they're not initially in any aircraft)\n- person7 should remain at city0\n\nFor plane2 and plane3:\n- They should not fly anywhere (neither slow nor fast)\n- They should not refuel\n- No person should board them\n- No person should debark from them (though no one is initially on them)\n- They should remain at their initial locations\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express this as state-based constraints. Since this is about things that should NOT happen throughout the plan, I need to use temporal logic.\n\nThe constraint should be that throughout the entire plan execution (always):\n- person7 remains located at city0\n- plane2 remains located at city2  \n- plane3 remains located at city3\n- No person is ever in plane2\n- No person is ever in plane3\n\nLet me write this in PDDL3.0:\n\n```pddl\n(always (and \n    (located person7 city0)\n    (located plane2 city2)\n    (located plane3 city3)\n    (forall (?p - person) (not (in ?p plane2)))\n    (forall (?p - person) (not (in ?p plane3)))\n))\n```\n\nI'll verify the constraint ensures these specific requirements:\n- person7 stays at city0\n- plane2 stays at city2\n- plane3 stays at city3\n- No passengers on either plane\n- No movement or actions for these entities\n\nThe temporal logic constraint guarantees these entities remain completely static throughout the entire plan execution."
