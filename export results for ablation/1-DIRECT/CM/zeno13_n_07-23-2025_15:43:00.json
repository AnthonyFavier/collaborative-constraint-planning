Since this is a \"never\" constraint, I need to use the \"always\" operator to say that person7 is always located in city0.\n\nThe PDDL3.0 syntax for temporal constraints uses:\n- (always <condition>) - the condition must hold in all states\n- (sometime <condition>) - the condition must hold in at least one state\n- (at-most-once <condition>) - the condition can hold at most once\n- etc.\n\nSince person7 should never move, and person7 starts in city0, the constraint should be:\n(always (located person7 city0))\n\nThis ensures that person7 is always located in city0, which means it never moves from city0."
