Looking at the problem, I can see that:\n\n1. person7 is located at city0 initially\n2. plane2 is located at city2 initially \n3. plane3 is located at city3 initially\n\nThe goal doesn't mention person7, plane2, or plane3, so they're not required to be moved anywhere specific.\n\n\"Should be ignored\" in planning context likely means that these entities should not be used or involved in the plan. For a person, this would mean they should not board any aircraft. For aircraft, this would mean they should not be used for any actions (no boarding, no flying, no refueling).\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to express constraints that prevent these entities from being involved in actions. Since PDDL constraints are state-based and can only refer to predicates and fluents (not actions directly), I need to think about what states would indicate that these entities are being \"used\".\n\nFor person7: The constraint should be that person7 never boards any aircraft. So person7 should never satisfy the predicate (in person7 ?a) for any aircraft ?a.\n\nFor plane2 and plane3: The constraint should be that these planes are never used. This could mean:\n- No one ever boards them: (onboard plane2) = 0 and (onboard plane3) = 0\n- They never move from their initial locations\n- Their fuel is never consumed (stays at initial level) or increases (no refueling)\n\nActually, let me look at the domain more carefully. The domain has action counters like:\n- (n_board ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)  \n\n\n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_refuel ?a - aircraft)\n\nThese action counters track the number of times specific actions occur. I can use these to precisely constrain the involvement of person7, plane2, and plane3. Specifically, I'll ensure zero occurrences of boarding, flying, or refueling actions for these entities across all possible scenarios.\n\nI'll modify the state constraints to directly prevent unwanted configurations. Plane2 and plane3 will be locked into their initial locations, and person7 will be prohibited from entering any aircraft. This approach simplifies the modeling by directly specifying the desired state restrictions.\n\nI'll use PDDL3.0's always operator to enforce these constraints throughout the entire plan, ensuring person7 remains grounded and specific planes stay in predetermined positions.\n\nThe constraint will explicitly list each aircraft to prevent person7's boarding, while maintaining precise location and occupancy requirements for the specified planes.\n\nThis approach creates a rigid planning framework that isolates certain transportation resources, effectively removing them from potential route calculations by establishing immutable conditions."
