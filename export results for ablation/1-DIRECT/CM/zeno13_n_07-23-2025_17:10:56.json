The constraint is \"The flying route from city0 to city3 is too windy and unsafe. There should be no flight on that route.\"\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there are two actions for flying:\n1. flyslow - with parameters (?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n2. flyfast - with parameters (?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n\nThe constraint says there should be no flight from city0 to city3. This means that neither flyslow nor flyfast should be performed with parameters where ?c1 = city0 and ?c2 = city3.\n\nHowever, the instruction says that PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based and can only refer to existing predicates and fluents, not to actions. So I can't directly reference the actions.\n\nLooking at the domain, I see there are counter fluents for actions:\n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n\nThese fluents get incremented when the corresponding actions are performed. So if I want to ensure no flight from city0 to city3, I need to ensure that these counters remain 0 for all aircraft.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can use temporal logic operators. The constraint should be that always (for all time), the sum of n_flyslow and n_flyfast from city0 to city3 for all aircraft should be 0.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The constraint is state-based, so I need to express it in terms of the state variables (predicates and fluents).\n\nThe way to express \"no flight from city0 to city3\" using the available fluents would be to ensure that for all aircraft, the counters n_flyslow and n_flyfast from city0 to city3 remain 0.\n\n\nI'll use the \"always\" temporal operator to specify this constraint across all aircraft. This means creating a comprehensive set of conditions that prevent any aircraft from flying between these specific cities. The constraint will systematically set the flight counters to zero for multiple aircraft, ensuring complete prohibition of flights on this route.\n\nThe generalized approach uses forall quantification, which elegantly applies the restriction to every aircraft in the domain. By setting both slow and fast flight counters to zero, I've created a comprehensive travel blockade between the specified cities."
