So I need to think about how to capture this constraint in terms of state properties.\n\nLooking at the domain more carefully, I can see that there are counter fluents for each action:\n- (n_board ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)\n- (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city) \n- (n_flyslow ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_flyfast ?a - aircraft ?c1 ?c2 - city)\n- (n_refuel ?a - aircraft)\n\nEach of these counters gets increased by 1 whenever the corresponding action is performed. So if I want plane2 and plane3 to never perform any action, I need to ensure that all their action counters remain 0.\n\nSince this is a \"never\" constraint, I need to use the \"always\" temporal operator in PDDL3.0.\n\nThe constraint would be:\n(always (and \n    (= (n_refuel plane2) 0)\n    (= (n_refuel plane3) 0)\n    (forall (?c1 ?c2 - city) (= (n_flyslow plane2 ?c1 ?c2) 0))\n    (forall (?c1 ?c2 - city) (= (n_flyfast plane2 ?c1 ?c2) 0))\n    (forall (?c1 ?c2 - city) (= (n_flyslow plane3 ?c1 ?c2) 0))\n    (forall (?c1 ?c2 - city) (= (n_flyfast plane3 ?c1 ?c2) 0))\n    (forall (?p - person ?c - city) (= (n_board ?p plane2 ?c) 0))\n    (forall (?p - person ?c - city) (= (n_debark ?p plane2 ?c) 0))\n    (forall (?p - person ?c - city) (= (n_board ?p plane3 ?c) 0))\n    (forall (?p - person ?c - city) (= (n_debark ?p plane3 ?c) 0))))\n\nI'll ensure that both plane2 and plane3 have zero counters for all possible actions across different cities and with different people. This comprehensive approach prevents any action from being performed by these specific aircraft."
