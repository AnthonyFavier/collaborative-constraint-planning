Since it should \"never\" be true, I need to use the \"always\" operator with negation.\n\nThe syntax would be:\n`(always (not (exists (?r - rover) (calibrated camera4 ?r))))`\n\nOr more simply, since we want to say that camera4 should never be calibrated with any rover, we can use:\n`(always (forall (?r - rover) (not (calibrated camera4 ?r))))`\n\nBoth formulations are equivalent - the first says \"it's always the case that there doesn't exist a rover such that camera4 is calibrated with it\", while the second says \"it's always the case that for all rovers, camera4 is not calibrated with them\".\n\nI think the second formulation is clearer, so I'll go with that."

Looking at the PDDL problem, I can see that rover2 is one of the rovers available in the domain. \n\nTo translate this into state-based constraints that follow Linear Temporal Logic, I need to think about what it means for a rover to \"never be used\". In the context of this rover domain, a rover is \"used\" when it performs actions. However, since I need to avoid referring to actions directly and use state-based constraints, I need to think about what states would indicate that rover2 is being used.\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see that rover2 has the following capabilities:\n- It can move between waypoints (navigate action)\n- It can sample rocks (samplerock action)  \n- It can take images (takeimage action)\n- It can communicate data\n- It can recharge\n- It can drop samples\n- It can calibrate cameras\n\nThe key insight is that if rover2 is never used, then:\n1. It should always remain at its initial location (waypoint3)\n2. Its energy level should never change from the initial value (50)\n3. It should never acquire any samples, images, or analysis data\n4. Its store should always remain empty\n5. Any cameras on rover2 should never be calibrated\n\nLet me look at what rover2 has initially:\n- in rover2 waypoint3\n- energy rover2 = 50\n- store_of rover2store rover2\n- empty rover2store\n- equipped_for_rock_analysis rover2\n- equipped_for_imaging rover2\n- on_board camera4 rover2\n\nSo the constraints should be:\n1. Rover2 should always remain at waypoint3\n2. Rover2's energy should always remain at 50\n3. Rover2's store should always remain empty\n4. Rover2 should never have any rock analysis data\n5. Rover2 should never have any image data\n\n\n6. Camera4 (which is on rover2) should never be calibrated\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the constraint. The most direct approach is to ensure rover2 remains completely inactive, preventing any state changes that would indicate its use. This means maintaining its initial configuration absolutely unchanged throughout the entire problem-solving process.\n\nThe key restrictions involve preventing rover2 from performing any actions that would modify its initial state. Specifically, this means blocking movement, energy consumption, sample collection, and camera operations. By constraining these fundamental action types, we effectively neutralize rover2's potential involvement in any mission tasks.\n\nThe core strategy is to create a set of absolute prohibitions that render rover2 completely static and non-functional, ensuring it cannot contribute to or interfere with any mission objectives.\n\nThe minimal constraints focus on two critical aspects: location immobility and energy preservation, which fundamentally prevent any meaningful rover activity.\n\nBy mandating rover2 stays at waypoint3 and maintains constant energy at 50, I effectively neutralize its operational capacity. Adding the camera calibration constraint provides an extra layer of inaction assurance.\n\nThese strategic limitations create a comprehensive lockdown of rover2's potential functionality."
