The constraint says that for each person-city pair, the person can be dropped off at that city at most once during the entire execution.\n\nLooking at the PDDL domain, I can see there's a function `(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)` which tracks the number of times person ?p has debarked from aircraft ?a at city ?c.\n\nHowever, the constraint is about dropping off from \"an aircraft\" in a city, which means it's about the total number of times a person is dropped off in a city, regardless of which aircraft they were on.\n\nWait, let me re-read this: \"each person can be dropped off from an aircraft in any specific city at most once\". This could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. For each person-city pair, the person can be dropped off at that city at most once (regardless of which aircraft)\n2. For each person-aircraft-city combination, the person can be dropped off from that specific aircraft in that specific city at most once\n\nLooking at the wording \"dropped off from an aircraft in any specific city\", I think it's interpretation 1 - for each person and each city, that person can be dropped off in that city at most once, regardless of which aircraft they came from.\n\nBut the function `n_debark` tracks per aircraft. So I need to sum across all aircraft for a given person-city pair.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I can use the `always` temporal operator to express constraints that must hold throughout execution.\n\nThe constraint would be: for every person ?p and every city ?c, the sum of (n_debark ?p ?a ?c) across all aircraft ?a should be at most 1.\n\nLet me think about how to express this in PDDL3.0. \n\nI'll focus on summing across the three aircraft. Since there are exactly three planes (plane1, plane2, plane3), I can explicitly calculate the total debarks for each person-city combination. This means I'll need to add up the debark counts from all three aircraft to ensure no person is dropped off more than once in any specific city.\n\nThe key challenge is creating a constraint that tracks the total debarks across all aircraft while maintaining the \"at most once\" rule for each person-city pair.\n\nI'll need to carefully initialize the n_debark functions to ensure the constraint works correctly. The PDDL constraint looks solid, explicitly limiting total debarks to 1 using the `always` and `forall` operators.\n\nThe key insight is tracking total debarks per person-city combination across all aircraft. This prevents multiple drops in the same city, maintaining the travel logic's integrity.\n\nThe numeric function semantics default to 0, which simplifies initialization and ensures clean constraint handling.\n\nI'll use a straightforward constraint that captures the core requirement of single-city debarking for each person."

The effect of this action includes:\n- (not (in ?p ?a))\n- (located ?p ?c)\n- (decrease (onboard ?a) 1)\n- (increase (n_debark ?p ?a ?c) 1)\n\nThe constraint is about limiting how many times a person can be debarked in the same city. \n\nSince constraints must be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, I can't directly refer to the \"debark\" action. Instead, I need to think about what this constraint means in terms of states.\n\nThe constraint means that for any person and any city, the person should never be debarked more than once in that city. Looking at the domain, there's a function (n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city) that tracks the number of times a person has been debarked from an aircraft in a city.\n\nHowever, the user constraint is about debarking in the same city more than once, regardless of which aircraft. So I need to think about this differently.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint \"A person should never be debarked in a same city more than once\" means that for any person P and any city C, person P should not be debarked in city C more than once throughout the entire execution.\n\nSince I need to avoid explicit PDDL language and make this state-based, I can rephrase this as:\n\n1. For each person and each city, the total number of times that person has been debarked in that city should never exceed 1.\n\nBut wait, I need to be more careful about the constraint. The n_debark function tracks debarkings per person, per aircraft, per city. \n\nI realize the constraint requires a more nuanced interpretation. It fundamentally prevents a person from landing in the same city multiple times, regardless of the aircraft used. This means once a person has been debarked in a specific city, any subsequent attempt to debark in that same city would violate the constraint.\n\nThe key challenge is translating this into a state-based logical representation that captures the essence of the restriction without relying on specific PDDL constructs.\n\nThe constraint boils down to a simple yet critical rule: a person's journey through cities must be unique, with no repeated city landings. Each city can only be a person's destination once during the entire plan's execution."
