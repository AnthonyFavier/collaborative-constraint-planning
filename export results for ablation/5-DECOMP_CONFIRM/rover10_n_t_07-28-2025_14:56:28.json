In PDDL3.0:\n- \"always\" is the temporal operator for \"at all times\"\n- \"forall\" is universal quantification\n- \"not\" is negation\n- The predicate \"(in ?r waypoint2)\" means rover ?r is at waypoint2\n\nSo (always (forall (?r - rover) (not (in ?r waypoint2)))) should be correct."

In PDDL3.0, this would be an \"always\" constraint since it needs to hold at all times\n4.

The constraint means:\n- At all times during the execution, no rover should be located at waypoint2\n- At all times during the execution, no rover should be located at waypoint5\n\nIn PDDL terms, this would be about the predicate (in ?rover ?waypoint), but I need to avoid explicit PDDL language.\n\nI should decompose this into clear natural language constraints:\n\n1. No rover should ever be located at waypoint2\n2. No rover should ever be located at waypoint5\n\nActually, I could be more specific and mention each rover explicitly, but that might be unnecessarily verbose. The original constraint is clear enough when decomposed into the two waypoints.\n\nLet me think about whether I need to be more specific. The constraint applies to all rovers, so I could say:\n1. Rover0 should never be located at waypoint2\n2. Rover1 should never be located at waypoint2\n3. Rover2 should never be located at waypoint2\n4. Rover3 should never be located at waypoint2\n5. Rover0 should never be located at waypoint5\n6. Rover1 should never be located at waypoint5\n7. Rover2 should never be located at waypoint5\n8. Rover3 should never be located at waypoint5\n\nBut this seems overly verbose. \n\nThe constraint is straightforward and comprehensive. It ensures that across all rovers and throughout the entire mission, waypoints 2 and 5 remain completely off-limits, providing a clear and concise restriction on rover movement."
