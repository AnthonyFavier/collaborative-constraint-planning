The constraint is:\n\n\"For each person and each city, the total number of times that person has been debarked in that city across all aircraft should never exceed 1.\"\n\nLet me analyze this constraint:\n\n1. It's about the total number of times a person has been debarked in a city\n2. This should be summed across all aircraft\n3. This total should never exceed 1\n4. This applies to each person-city pair\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see there's a function `(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)` which counts the number of times person ?p has been debarked from aircraft ?a in city ?c.\n\nSo for a given person ?p and city ?c, I need to sum `(n_debark ?p ?a ?c)` across all aircraft ?a, and this sum should never exceed 1.\n\nSince this is a \"never exceed\" constraint, I need to use the `always` temporal operator, and the constraint should be that the sum is <= 1.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I would write this as:\n\n```\n(always (forall (?p - person ?c - city)\n    (<= (+ (n_debark ?p plane1 ?c) (n_debark ?p plane2 ?c) (n_debark ?p plane3 ?c)) 1)))\n```\n\nWait, but this hardcodes the aircraft names. I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the problem, I can see there are exactly 3 aircraft: plane1, plane2, plane3. So I can explicitly sum over these.\n\nBut let me think about the PDDL3.0 syntax more carefully. In PDDL3.0, I can use quantifiers in constraints.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The constraint should be that for each person-city pair, the sum of n_debark over all aircraft should never exceed 1.\n\n\nI'll explicitly sum the debark counts for the three known aircraft, ensuring no person debarks more than once in any given city across all planes. The constraint uses the `always` temporal operator to enforce this rule consistently throughout the problem's execution.\n\nThe PDDL3.0 syntax confirms the constraint's structure, with the `forall` quantifier checking every person-city combination and limiting total debarks to one or zero."

So I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nThe constraint is saying that for any person and any city, that person should not be debarked in that city more than once across all aircraft.\n\nSince constraints must be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, and I can't directly refer to actions, I need to think about this in terms of states.\n\nThe key insight is that I need to constrain the sum of debark operations for each person-city pair across all aircraft.\n\nLet me refine this:\n\n1. For each person, the total number of times they are debarked in any specific city (across all aircraft) should never exceed 1.\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. The constraint is about limiting debark operations. Since I can't refer to actions directly, I need to refer to the counter that tracks these operations.\n\nThe function `(n_debark ?p - person ?a - aircraft ?c - city)` tracks how many times person p has been debarked from aircraft a in city c.\n\nSo the constraint would be: for any person p and city c, the sum of `(n_debark p a c)` over all aircraft a should never exceed 1.\n\nBut I need to express this in natural language without PDDL syntax.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n1. For each person and each city, the total count of that person being debarked in that city across all aircraft should never exceed 1.\n\n\nI can distill this to a simple, clear rule: each individual can only be debarked once in any specific city, regardless of the aircraft used. This ensures no repeated city landings for the same person, maintaining a unique travel pattern across different transportation methods."
