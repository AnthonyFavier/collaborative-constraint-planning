The constraint is about a rock sample at waypoint6\n2. It must \"always remain\" there - this suggests a temporal logic constraint that should hold throughout the execution\n3. Looking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint)` \n4. In the problem instance, I can see `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` is initially true\n5. The constraint is saying this should always be true\n\nIn PDDL3.0, \"always\" constraints are expressed using the `(always ...)` temporal logic operator.\n\nSo the constraint should be:\n`(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))`\n\nThis means that throughout the entire execution of the plan, the predicate `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` must remain true.\n\nLooking at the domain, the only action that can change the `at_rock_sample` predicate is the `samplerock` action, which has the effect `(not (at_rock_sample ?p))`. So this constraint would prevent any rover from sampling the rock at waypoint6."

The rock sample should always remain at waypoint6 (meaning `at_rock_sample waypoint6` should always be true)\n2. No rover should ever have rock analysis data from waypoint6 (meaning `have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint6` should never be true for any rover)\n\nThese are complementary constraints that together ensure the rock sample at waypoint6 is never collected.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint is state-based and should follow Linear Temporal Logic. The user constraint is \"The rock sample at waypoint6 should never be collected\".\n\nIn terms of states:\n- Initially, `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` is true\n- If the rock sample is collected, then `(at_rock_sample waypoint6)` becomes false\n- Also, if collected, some rover would have `(have_rock_analysis rover waypoint6)` become true\n\nSo the refined constraints could be:\n\n\nI'll ensure the rock sample remains untouched by preventing any actions that would remove it from its original location. This means blocking collection attempts and maintaining its initial state throughout the mission's execution."
