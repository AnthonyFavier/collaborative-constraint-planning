In PDDL3.0, constraints are typically written in the (:constraints) section and use temporal logic operators.\n\nThe constraint should be:\nalways (forall (?a - aircraft) (imply (located ?a city2) (not (= (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a)))))\n\nThis reads as: \"Always, for all aircraft a, if a is located in city2, then the fuel of a is not equal to the capacity of a.\"\n\n\nI'll refine the constraint to precisely capture the temporal requirement. The key is using the \"always\" temporal operator to ensure the condition holds throughout the entire plan execution. The logical structure uses a universal quantifier (forall) with an implication to specify the condition for planes in city2."

                                        "text": "Let me analyze the user constraint: \"City2 is out of fuel, planes can't refuel there\"\n\nLooking at the PDDL domain, I can see there's a refuel action:\n```\n(:action refuel\n    :parameters (?a - aircraft)\n    :precondition (and (> (capacity ?a) (fuel ?a))\n    )\n    :effect (and (assign (fuel ?a) (capacity ?a))\n            (increase (n_refuel ?a) 1))\n)\n```\n\nThe refuel action doesn't have any location-based preconditions in the domain definition, which means normally planes can refuel anywhere they are located. However, the user wants to constrain this so that planes cannot refuel when they are in city2.\n\nSince I need to create state-based constraints (not action-based), I need to think about this differently. The constraint is essentially saying that if a plane is located in city2, it should not be able to refuel there.\n\nHowever, since constraints are state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, I can't directly reference the refuel action. Instead, I need to think about what states would be inconsistent with this constraint.\n\nThe constraint \"planes can't refuel there\" means that if a plane is in city2, it should not increase its fuel level to its maximum capacity (which is what refueling does).\n\nSo I could rephrase this as:\n- If a plane is located in city2, then its fuel level should not jump to its maximum capacity\n- Or more generally: No plane should refuel while located in city2\n\nBut since I need state-based constraints, I should focus on the states that would indicate refueling has occurred in city2.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The user constraint is about preventing refueling in city2. Since the refuel action sets fuel to capacity, I could express this as:\n\n\"If a plane is located in city2, then its fuel should not be equal to its capacity (unless it arrived there already at full capacity)\"\n \nThis approach might be overly restrictive, as planes could legitimately arrive in city2 with full fuel tanks. I'll explore alternative interpretations that capture the core constraint more precisely.\n\nThe most direct state-based formulation would focus on preventing fuel increases while in city2. This means creating a constraint that ensures no plane can have its fuel level maximized during its stay in the location.\n\nI'm considering a nuanced definition that allows planes already at full capacity to remain in city2, while preventing any refueling actions that would bring a plane to maximum fuel levels. The key is distinguishing between planes arriving full versus those being refueled to full capacity during their stay.\n\nThe constraint essentially aims to block refueling operations in city2, which suggests a rule preventing fuel from reaching maximum levels through any action while in that specific location.\n\nMy current approach focuses on state-based logic: a plane in city2 cannot have its fuel set to maximum capacity through an action, preserving flexibility for planes that naturally arrive at full fuel.\n\nThis requires carefully parsing the difference between a plane's initial state versus actions that would artificially maximize its fuel during its city2 presence. The goal is a precise, actionable constraint that prevents refueling without unnecessarily restricting plane movements.\n\nBy specifying that no plane in city2 can transition to a full fuel state, I'm creating a nuanced rule that blocks refueling while allowing natural flight dynamics. The constraint targets the specific mechanism of fuel replenishment without overly rigid limitations.\n\nThe initial plane configurations - plane1 at city4 with 205 fuel, plane2 at city2 with 1469 fuel - provide concrete context for testing this constraint's practical application.\n\nExamining plane2's initial state reveals an important detail: its current fuel is below capacity, which means my proposed rule wouldn't interfere with its starting condition. This observation validates the constraint's precision in addressing the refueling prevention goal."
