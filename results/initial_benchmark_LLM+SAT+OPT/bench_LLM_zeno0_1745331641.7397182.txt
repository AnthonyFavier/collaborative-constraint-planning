I'll solve this ZTRAVEL problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

Looking at the problem:
- We need to transport person1 from city1 to city2
- We have plane1 in city1 with 4000 units of fuel
- The distance between city1 and city2 is 810
- We need to minimize total-fuel-used

Let me analyze the possible actions:
1. Flying slow burns 4 fuel units per distance unit (810 × 4 = 3240 fuel)
2. Flying fast burns 15 fuel units per distance unit (810 × 15 = 12150 fuel)

Since flying slow uses less fuel and we have enough fuel (4000 > 3240), the optimal plan is:

```
(board person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
```

This plan will:
1. Board person1 onto plane1 in city1
2. Fly plane1 slowly from city1 to city2 (using 3240 fuel units)
3. Debark person1 from plane1 in city2

Total fuel used: 3240 units

=================
plan:
(board person1 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
