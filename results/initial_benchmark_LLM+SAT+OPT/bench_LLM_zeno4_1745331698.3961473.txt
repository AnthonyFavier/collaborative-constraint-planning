I'll solve this ZTRAVEL-2-5 problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

After analyzing the problem, here's my solution:

```
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(board person2 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person2 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city1)
(board person4 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city0)
(debark person4 plane1 city0)
```

Total fuel used: 4158

Explanation:
1. Plane1 flies from city2 to city1 (1004 fuel)
2. Person2 boards plane1 in city1
3. Plane1 flies from city1 to city2 with person2 (1004 fuel)
4. Person2 debarks in city2 (goal achieved for person2)
5. Plane2 flies from city2 to city1 (1004 fuel)
6. Person4 boards plane1 in city2
7. Plane1 flies from city2 to city0 with person4 (1486 fuel)
8. Person4 debarks in city0 (goal achieved for person4)

Note that person3 is already at city0 and person5 is already at city2, so they're already at their goal locations. The plan achieves all goals while minimizing fuel usage.

=================
plan:
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(board person2 plane1 city1)
(flyslow plane1 city1 city2)
(debark person2 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city1)
(board person4 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city0)
(debark person4 plane1 city0)
