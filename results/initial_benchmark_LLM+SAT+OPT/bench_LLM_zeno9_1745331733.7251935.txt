I'll solve this ZTRAVEL problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

After analyzing the problem, here's my solution:

```
(refuel plane1)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city4)
(board person5 plane1 city4)
(board person1 plane1 city4)
(flyslow plane1 city4 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city1)
(debark person5 plane1 city1)
(refuel plane3)
(board person2 plane3 city1)
(flyslow plane3 city1 city0)
(debark person2 plane3 city0)
(board person4 plane3 city0)
(flyslow plane3 city0 city3)
(debark person4 plane3 city3)
(board person6 plane3 city3)
(board person7 plane3 city3)
(flyslow plane3 city3 city4)
(debark person6 plane3 city4)
(debark person7 plane3 city4)
(board person3 plane2 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city4)
(debark person3 plane2 city4)
```

This plan:
1. Uses plane1 to transport person1 to city2 and person5 to city1
2. Uses plane3 to transport person2 to city0, person4 to city3, and persons 6 and 7 to city4
3. Uses plane2 to transport person3 to city4

The plan minimizes fuel usage by:
- Using flyslow instead of flyfast when possible
- Efficiently combining passenger routes
- Refueling only when necessary
- Choosing appropriate aircraft for each journey based on their fuel consumption rates

All goal conditions are satisfied with this plan.
