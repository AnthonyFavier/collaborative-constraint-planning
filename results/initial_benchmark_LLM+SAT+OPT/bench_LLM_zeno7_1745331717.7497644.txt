I'll solve this ZTRAVEL-2-6 problem by finding a plan that minimizes the total fuel used.

After analyzing the problem, here's my solution:

```
(flyslow plane1 city2 city3)
(board person1 plane1 city3)
(board person5 plane1 city3)
(flyslow plane1 city3 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(debark person5 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city1 city3)
(board person4 plane2 city1)
(board person3 plane2 city3)
(flyslow plane2 city3 city2)
(debark person3 plane2 city2)
(board person6 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city0)
(debark person6 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person6 plane1 city2)
(debark person6 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city1)
(debark person4 plane2 city1)
```

This plan:
1. Moves plane1 to city3 to pick up person1 and person5
2. Returns to city2 and drops them off
3. Moves plane2 to city3, picking up person4 on the way
4. Picks up person3 in city3 and flies to city2
5. Drops off person3 in city2
6. Uses plane1 to transport person6 from city0 to city2
7. Returns plane2 to city1 with person4 on board
8. Drops off person4 in city1

The plan satisfies all goal conditions while minimizing fuel usage by using slow flying and efficient routing.

plan:
(flyslow plane1 city2 city3)
(board person1 plane1 city3)
(board person5 plane1 city3)
(flyslow plane1 city3 city2)
(debark person1 plane1 city2)
(debark person5 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city1 city3)
(board person4 plane2 city1)
(board person3 plane2 city3)
(flyslow plane2 city3 city2)
(debark person3 plane2 city2)
(board person6 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane1 city2 city0)
(debark person6 plane1 city0)
(flyslow plane1 city0 city2)
(board person6 plane1 city2)
(debark person6 plane1 city2)
(flyslow plane2 city2 city1)
(debark person4 plane2 city1)
