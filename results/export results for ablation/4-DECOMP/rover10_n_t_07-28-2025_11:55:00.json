This is a temporal constraint that needs to hold throughout the entire execution.\n3. In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed using the \"always\" temporal operator.\n4. The predicate for a rover being at a waypoint is \"(in ?rover ?waypoint)\".\n5. Since we want NO rover to be at waypoint2, we need to negate the existence of any rover at waypoint2.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be:\n- \"always\" to indicate this must hold throughout execution\n- \"not\" to negate the condition\n- \"exists\" or we can use universal quantification over rovers\n\nLooking at the domain, I can see that rovers are of type \"rover\" and waypoints are of type \"waypoint\". The predicate \"(in ?x - rover ?y - waypoint)\" indicates a rover is at a waypoint.\n\nFor \"no rover should ever be in waypoint2\", I need to express that for all time, there does not exist a rover that is in waypoint2.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be:\n(always (not (exists (?r - rover) (in ?r waypoint2))))\n\nAlternatively, it could be expressed as:\n(always (forall (?r - rover) (not (in ?r waypoint2))))\n\nBoth are equivalent. The second form might be clearer: \"always, for all rovers, it is not the case that the rover is in waypoint2\".\n\nLet me go with the forall version as it's often more readable."

This is a temporal constraint that should hold throughout the entire planning process\n2. In PDDL3.0, we can use temporal logic operators like \"always\" \n3. The constraint is saying that at no point in time should any rover be at waypoint5\n4. Looking at the domain, I can see there's a predicate `(in ?x - rover ?y - waypoint)` that represents a rover being at a waypoint\n\nSo the constraint should be: for all time, for all rovers, it should not be the case that the rover is in waypoint5.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be expressed using the \"always\" temporal operator and universal quantification over rovers.\n\nThe syntax would be:\n```\n(always (forall (?r - rover) (not (in ?r waypoint5))))\n```\n\nThis reads as: \"Always, for all rovers r, it is not the case that r is in waypoint5\"\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- `always` ensures the constraint holds at all times\n- `forall (?r - rover)` quantifies over all rover objects\n- `not (in ?r waypoint5)` ensures that rover r is not in waypoint5\n\nThis captures the meaning of \"No rover should ever be in waypoint5\" correctly."

This is a state-based constraint that should apply throughout the entire plan execution.\n\nThe constraint \"No rover should ever be in waypoint2 or waypoint5\" can be decomposed into:\n1. No rover should ever be in waypoint2\n2. No rover should ever be in waypoint5\n\nSince there are 4 rovers, I could be more specific:\n- rover0 should never be in waypoint2\n- rover0 should never be in waypoint5 \n- rover1 should never be in waypoint2\n- rover1 should never be in waypoint5\n- rover2 should never be in waypoint2\n- rover2 should never be in waypoint5\n- rover3 should never be in waypoint2\n- rover3 should never be in waypoint5\n\nBut this might be too granular. Let me think about a cleaner way to express this.\n\nActually, the simpler decomposition works well:\n1. No rover should ever be in waypoint2\n2. No rover should ever be in waypoint5\n\nThis captures the meaning completely - it means that throughout the entire execution of the plan, none of the rovers (rover0, rover1, rover2, rover3) should be located at waypoint2, and none of them should be located at waypoint5.\n\nThese constraints are:\n- State-based (they refer to the location state of rovers)\n- Follow Linear Temporal Logic (they apply \"always\" throughout the plan)\n- Don't directly refer to actions (they refer to the resulting states)\n\n\n- Are complementary (one for each forbidden waypoint)\n- Capture the complete meaning of the original constraint\n\nI've verified that both waypoint2 and waypoint5 exist in the PDDL objects, confirming the constraints' applicability. The approach provides a clear, concise way to express the location restrictions for all rovers across the entire plan execution."
