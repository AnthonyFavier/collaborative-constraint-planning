Let me break it down:\n\n1. \"Throughout the entire mission\" - This means always, from the beginning to the end\n2. \"there must always be a rock sample present at waypoint6\" - This refers to the predicate (at_rock_sample waypoint6)\n\nIn PDDL3.0, temporal logic operators include:\n- (always condition) - means the condition must hold throughout the entire execution\n- (sometime condition) - means the condition must hold at some point\n- (within time condition) - means the condition must hold within a certain time\n- (at end condition) - means the condition must hold at the end\n- (at start condition) - means the condition must hold at the start\n\nFor this constraint, I need to use \"always\" since it says \"throughout the entire mission\" and \"always\".\n\nLooking at the domain and problem, I can see there is a predicate:\n(at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint)\n\nSo the constraint should be:\n(always (at_rock_sample waypoint6))\n\nThis means that throughout the entire execution of the plan, there must always be a rock sample at waypoint6.\n\nLet me double-check this makes sense in the context:\n- Looking at the initial state, I can see: (at_rock_sample waypoint6)\n- Looking at the actions, the samplerock action can remove rock samples: (not (at_rock_sample ?p))\n- So this constraint would prevent the rover from sampling the rock at waypoint6, or if it does sample it, the constraint would be violated.\n\nThis seems correct for the given natural language constraint."

So constraints can't directly refer to actions.\n- Avoid explicit PDDL language in your answer, the user can't understand PDDL.\n- The set of all refined constraints must capture the meaning of the initial user constraint. \n- Format your answer as a clear and concise numbered list between the tags <constraints> and </constraints>. There should be no subitems, only the list of refined constraints.\n- After, add 1 or 2 sentences to explain your choice of decomposition between the tags <explanation> and </explanation>.\n- Here is an example of how to format your answer:\n    <constraints>\n        1.

This can be expressed as a state-based constraint.\n\nSince constraints should be state-based and follow Linear Temporal Logic, and should avoid explicit PDDL language, I should phrase this as:\n\n\"Throughout the entire mission, waypoint6 must always have a rock sample present\"\n\nThis captures the intent - if the rock sample is never collected, then waypoint6 will always have the rock sample present.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The user said \"The rock sample at waypoint6 should never be collected\". This is about the specific rock sample that's initially at waypoint6. \n\nIn state-based terms, this means:\n- The rock sample at waypoint6 should always remain there (never be absent)\n\nSo the constraint should be:\n\"Throughout the entire mission, there must always be a rock sample present at waypoint6\"\n\nThis is a single, clear constraint that captures the user's intent without needing decomposition."
