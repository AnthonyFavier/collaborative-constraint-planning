This is a constraint about rover2's energy level remaining constant throughout the entire execution\n2. In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed as a temporal constraint\n3. The energy level is represented by the fluent (energy rover2)\n4. \"Never change\" means that at all times, the energy should remain the same as it was initially\n\nIn PDDL3.0, temporal constraints can be expressed using temporal logic operators like:\n- always (G)\n- eventually (F) \n- until (U)\n- next (X)\n\nFor \"never change\", I need to express that the energy level should always remain the same as its initial value.\n\nLooking at the problem file, I can see that initially (= (energy rover2) 50).\n\nSo the constraint should be: always, the energy of rover2 equals 50.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this would be written as:\n(always (= (energy rover2) 50))\n\nBut wait, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint is that it should \"never change\", not that it should always be 50. The difference is subtle but important - if for some reason the initial energy wasn't 50, we'd still want it to never change from whatever it starts at.\n\nHowever, in PDDL3.0 constraints, we can only refer to the current state, not to the initial state directly. So we need to express this as the energy always being equal to its initial value.\n\nSince I can see from the problem that the initial energy of rover2 is 50, I can write:\n(always (= (energy rover2) 50))\n\nActually, let me double-check the PDDL3.0 syntax for temporal constraints. In PDDL3.0, temporal constraints are typically written using modal operators:\n\n- (always <condition>) - the condition must hold at all times\n\n\n- (sometime <condition>) - the condition must hold at some point\n- (at-most-once <condition>) - the condition can hold at most once\n- (sometime-after <condition1> <condition2>) - condition2 must hold sometime after condition1\n- (sometime-before <condition1> <condition2>) - condition2 must hold sometime before condition1\n\nI'll explore alternative ways to express the \"never change\" constraint, focusing on ensuring the energy remains constant throughout the rover's execution."
