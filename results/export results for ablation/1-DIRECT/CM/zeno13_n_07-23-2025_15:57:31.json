Looking at the domain, we have actions like:\n- board: person boards an aircraft\n- debark: person debarks from an aircraft  \n- flyslow: aircraft flies slow between cities\n- flyfast: aircraft flies fast between cities\n- refuel: aircraft refuels\n\nIf person7, plane2, and plane3 should be \"ignored\", this likely means:\n1. Person7 should not board any aircraft\n2. Person7 should not debark from any aircraft\n3. Plane2 should not fly anywhere\n4. Plane2 should not refuel\n5. Plane3 should not fly anywhere\n6. Plane3 should not refuel\n7. No person should board plane2 or plane3\n8. No person should debark from plane2 or plane3\n\nHowever, the instructions say that PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based and can only refer to existing predicates and fluents, not to actions. So I need to think about this differently.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints typically use the \"always\" operator to specify that certain conditions must hold throughout the plan execution.\n\nLooking at the predicates and fluents available:\n- (located ?x - locatable ?c - city)\n- (in ?p - person ?a - aircraft)\n- (fuel ?a - aircraft)\n- (onboard ?a - aircraft)\n- etc.\n\nIf person7, plane2, and plane3 should be \"ignored\", this could mean:\n1. Person7 should never be in any aircraft: (always (not (in person7 ?a)))\n2. Plane2 should never have anyone onboard: (always (= (onboard plane2) 0))\n\n\n3. Plane3 should never have anyone onboard: (always (= (onboard plane3) 0))\n\nI'll specify location constraints for these entities. Since person7 is at city0, plane2 at city2, and plane3 at city3, I'll create constraints to keep them stationary. The key is to prevent any movement or interaction for these specific objects throughout the entire plan execution.\n\nThe constraints will ensure:\n1. Person7 remains fixed at city0\n2. Plane2 stays at city2\n3. Plane3 remains at city3\n\nThese constraints effectively \"ignore\" the specified entities by preventing their participation in any plan actions that would change their state or location. I'll stay at my initial location in city0, ensuring I don't participate in any plan actions. Plane2 will remain stationary in city2, and plane3 will stay fixed in city3. This approach effectively prevents these entities from being used, keeping them isolated from the main planning process. By constraining their movement to their starting positions, I create a clear boundary that prevents any potential interactions or state changes."
