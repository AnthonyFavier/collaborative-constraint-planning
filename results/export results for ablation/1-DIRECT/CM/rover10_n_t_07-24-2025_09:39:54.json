When this action is executed, it creates the predicate `(have_rock_analysis ?x ?p)` where ?x is the rover and ?p is the waypoint.\n\nSo the constraint is saying that `(have_rock_analysis ?rover waypoint1)` should be true before any other `(have_rock_analysis ?rover ?other_waypoint)` becomes true, where ?other_waypoint is not waypoint1.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, I need to use temporal logic operators. The constraint should be something like:\n- For any waypoint that is not waypoint1, if rock analysis is performed there, then rock analysis at waypoint1 must have been performed first.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n`(forall (?r - rover ?w - waypoint) (imply (and (not (= ?w waypoint1)) (have_rock_analysis ?r ?w)) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1)))`\n\nBut wait, let me think about this more carefully. The constraint is about ordering - waypoint1 should be first. In PDDL3.0, we can use temporal logic.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The constraint \"Rock analysis from waypoint1 should be performed first\" means that before any other rock analysis is performed, the rock analysis from waypoint1 must be performed first.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, this can be expressed using the `always` operator combined with an implication:\n\n\n`(always (forall (?r - rover ?w - waypoint) (imply (and (not (= ?w waypoint1)) (have_rock_analysis ?r ?w)) (have_rock_analysis ?r waypoint1))))`\n\nI'll verify the rock sample locations and ensure the constraint captures the precise requirement of performing waypoint1's rock analysis first across all rovers.\n\nThe temporal logic constraint ensures that for any rover and any waypoint other than waypoint1, rock analysis can only occur after waypoint1's rock analysis has been completed."
