In PDDL3.0, this would be expressed as a state-based constraint that requires rover1 to have all the images.\n\nLooking at the cameras and their capabilities:\n- rover1 has cameras: camera0 (supports lowres), camera1 (supports colour), camera2 (supports colour, lowres), camera3 (supports highres, lowres)\n- rover2 has camera4 (supports colour)  \n- rover3 has camera5 (supports colour, highres, lowres)\n\nSo rover1 can potentially take images in both colour and lowres modes.\n\nThe constraint should be that rover1 has all the images that are required by the goal. Since this is a state-based constraint, I need to express it in terms of the predicates that should be true.\n\nLooking at the goals:\n- (communicated_image_data objective3 colour)\n- (communicated_image_data objective2 colour)\n- (communicated_image_data objective3 lowres)\n\nBefore images can be communicated, they must first be taken by a rover. \n\nI'll specify the exact images rover1 needs to capture. The constraint requires rover1 to have specific images:\n- Colour image of objective3\n- Colour image of objective2\n- Lowres image of objective3\n\nThis constraint implies an \"always\" condition - once rover1 has taken these images, the requirement is satisfied. The challenge is ensuring rover1 can use its available cameras to meet these imaging requirements.\n\nThe interpretation of \"take all images\" could mean two potential scenarios:\n1. Rover1 exclusively captures images\n2. Rover1 captures all goal-specific images\n\nAnalyzing the context, it seems the second interpretation is more likely - rover1 must acquire all images needed for the mission goal. In PDDL3.0, this translates to an \"eventually\" constraint ensuring rover1 obtains these specific images."

I need to think about how to properly express this constraint in PDDL3.0.\n\nLooking at the constraint \"Rover1 should take all images\", I need to express this as a state-based constraint using standard PDDL predicates and operators.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints are typically expressed using:\n- always (something must always be true)\n- sometime (something must be true at some point)\n- at-most-once (something can happen at most once)\n- sometime-before (one thing must happen before another)\n- sometime-after (one thing must happen after another)\n\nHowever, the user is saying that \"eventually\" is not supported, so I need to be more careful about what temporal operators are actually available.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the problem, the constraint \"Rover1 should take all images\" could be interpreted as a constraint that should be added to the goal or as a constraint on the planning process itself.\n\nIf this is meant to be a goal constraint, then it would just be expressed as regular predicates that must be true in the goal state.\n\nBut if this is meant to be a planning constraint (like a trajectory constraint), then I need to use proper PDDL3.0 constraint syntax.\n\nLooking at standard PDDL3.0, the temporal constraints that are typically supported are:\n- (always <condition>)\n- (sometime <condition>)\n- (at-most-once <condition>)\n- (sometime-before <condition1> <condition2>)\n- (sometime-after <condition1> <condition2>)\n\nThe constraint \"Rover1 should take all images\" means that rover1 should be the one to take all the images that are required. This sounds like a \"sometime\" constraint - at some point, rover1 should have all the required images.\n\nLet me identify what \"all images\" means in this context. Looking at the goal, the images that need to be communicated are:\n\n\nI'll construct a precise sometime constraint that ensures rover1 captures all specified images at some point during the mission.\n\nThe constraint would specify that rover1 must have images for specific objectives and modes, ensuring comprehensive image collection by a single rover.\n\nThis approach allows flexibility in when the images are taken while guaranteeing rover1 completes the entire imaging task."
