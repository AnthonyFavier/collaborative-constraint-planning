This means that throughout the entire execution, only plane1 should be used for any actions, and plane2 and plane3 should not be used.\n\nLooking at the domain, the actions that involve aircraft are:\n1. board - takes an aircraft parameter\n2. debark - takes an aircraft parameter  \n3. flyslow - takes an aircraft parameter\n4. flyfast - takes an aircraft parameter\n5. refuel - takes an aircraft parameter\n\nSo the constraint needs to ensure that in any action involving an aircraft, only plane1 is used.\n\nIn PDDL3.0, constraints are state-based and can use temporal logic operators like `always`, `sometime`, `at-most-once`, etc.\n\nSince we want to restrict which aircraft can be used in actions, but PDDL3.0 constraints are state-based (not action-based), I need to think about this differently.\n\nOne approach could be to use the fact that when actions are executed, they change the state. For example:\n- When board is executed with an aircraft, the onboard count of that aircraft increases\n- When flyslow/flyfast is executed, the fuel of that aircraft decreases and its location changes\n- When refuel is executed, the fuel of that aircraft increases\n\nBut actually, I think the most direct way to express \"only use plane1\" is to say that throughout the execution, plane2 and plane3 should never change their state from the initial state. \n\nLooking at the initial state:\n- plane2 is located at city2, has fuel 1469, onboard 0\n- plane3 is located at city3, has fuel 1532, onboard 0\n\nSo the constraint could be that plane2 and plane3 always remain in their initial locations, with their initial fuel levels, and with 0 people onboard.\n\nLet me formulate this:\n\n```pddl\n(always (and \n    (located plane2 city2)\n    (= (fuel plane2) 1469)\n    (= (onboard plane2) 0)\n    (located plane3 city3)\n    (= (fuel plane3) 1532)\n    (= (onboard plane3) 0)\n))\n```\n\nI'll create a constraint that prevents plane2 and plane3 from being used by ensuring they maintain their initial state throughout the entire plan execution. This effectively restricts all aircraft actions to plane1."
