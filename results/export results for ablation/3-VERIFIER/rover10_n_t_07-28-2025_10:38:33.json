Since this is \"never\" (for all time), I need to use the \"always\" operator, but negated.\n\nThe constraint should be:\n- Always (for all rovers, not (in rover waypoint2) and not (in rover waypoint5))\n\nOr equivalently:\n- Always (not exists rover such that (in rover waypoint2) or (in rover waypoint5))\n\nLet me think about the syntax. In PDDL3.0, I can use:\n- (always <condition>) - means the condition must hold at all times\n- (forall (?x - type) <condition>) - universal quantification\n- (exists (?x - type) <condition>) - existential quantification\n\nSo I want: always (forall (?r - rover) (and (not (in ?r waypoint2)) (not (in ?r waypoint5))))\n\nActually, let me double-check the objects in the problem. I see:\n- rover0, rover1, rover2, rover3 are the rovers\n- waypoint0, waypoint1, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4, waypoint5, waypoint6 are the waypoints\n\nSo waypoint2 and waypoint5 exist in the problem.\n\nThe constraint \"No rover should ever be in waypoint2 or waypoint5\" means:\n\n\nI'll formulate a strict temporal constraint ensuring rovers are completely prohibited from these specific waypoints throughout the entire mission.\n\nThe precise PDDL3.0 representation uses the always operator with a universal quantifier, mandating that every single rover must simultaneously avoid both waypoint2 and waypoint5 across all time points."
