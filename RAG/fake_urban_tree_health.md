**FIELD REPORT**\
**Urban Tree Health Monitoring - Spring Assessment 2025**\
**Prepared by:** Department of Urban Ecology\
**Date:** April 12, 2025\
**Location:** Larkhill City Park, Zone B\
**CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL DATA**

---

### 1. Objective

To evaluate the overall health of mature and young trees located in Zone B of Larkhill City Park as part of the city's annual spring environmental audit. The study aimed to identify early signs of disease, assess soil moisture, and recommend any urgent interventions.

### 2. Methodology

* **Inspection Period:** March 15 - April 10, 2025
* **Inspection Team:**

  * Lead Arborist: Dr. Rachel Whitford
  * Field Technicians: Ivan Reyes, Maura Jin
* **Sample Size:** 312 trees
* **Tree Species Monitored:**

  * Red Maple (*Acer rubrum*)
  * London Plane (*Platanus × acerifolia*)
  * Eastern Redbud (*Cercis canadensis*)
  * Ginkgo (*Ginkgo biloba*)

### 3. Key Findings

#### A. Health Overview

| Condition Category | Count | % of Trees |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| Healthy            | 212   | 67.9%      |
| Minor Stress       | 64    | 20.5%      |
| Diseased           | 28    | 9.0%       |
| Critical Condition | 8     | 2.6%       |

* **Most common issues:**

  * Leaf chlorosis (noted in 48 trees)
  * Fungal growth at base (13 cases, mostly in shaded zones)
  * Bark cracking due to freeze-thaw cycles

#### B. Soil & Moisture Conditions

* Average soil moisture: 23.1% (slightly below optimal threshold of 26%)
* pH readings: 6.4-6.9 (neutral, suitable for most species)
* Two low-lying sectors (B3, B6) showed signs of compaction and drainage issues.

---

### 4. Interventions Recommended

* **Immediate Action:**

  * Remove 3 Ginkgo trees in critical decline (locations B2.4, B5.1, B6.7)
  * Apply fungicide treatment to 9 trees in B4 exhibiting early signs of powdery mildew
* **Spring Maintenance Plan:**

  * Aerate soil in Zones B3 and B6
  * Mulch base of younger maples to improve root insulation
  * Schedule deep watering twice weekly for Redbuds under 4 years old

---

### 5. Long-Term Suggestions

* Install soil moisture sensors for early warning of drought stress
* Pilot trial of mycorrhizal inoculants in Zone B5
* Consider replacing high-maintenance species (e.g., London Plane) with native drought-tolerant alternatives in future planting cycles
